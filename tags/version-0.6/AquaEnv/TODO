Before release:
	- check if all vignettes work (can be accessed via the command vignette etc.)
	- edit the CITATION file according to the paper and journal

Maybe:
	- implement the simple equation fitting from Dickson2007: is that the reason for the slight "misfit" between our values and the values of Dickson2007 (TAfit)


In the future:
	- include flag that allows for objects of class aquaenv without any attributes in their elements
	- add attribute "description" for K's
	- Gran procedure for "first guess" for TA fitting

	- add the possibility to add ARBITRARY acids/bases with arbitrary pK's: 
		-> to factor out the effect of various (unknown) organic acids
