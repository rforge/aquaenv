\usage{H3Atri(Sum, K1, K2, K3, H)}
\arguments{
  \item{Sum }{the total concentration of the acid in question in a unit consistent with all other input variables (e.g. mol/kg-solution)}
  \item{K1 }{the first dissociation constant of the acid in question in a unit consistent with all other input variables (e.g. mol/kg-solution)}
  \item{K2 }{the second dissociation constant of the acid in question in a unit consistent with all other input variables (e.g. mol/kg-solution)}
  \item{K3 }{the third dissociation constant of the acid in question in a unit consistent with all other input variables (e.g. mol/kg-solution)}
  \item{H }{the proton concentration in a unit consistent with all othert input variables (e.g. mol/kg-solution)}
