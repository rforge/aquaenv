\description{PRIVATE function: calculates the derivative of [HA(2-)] of a trivalent acid with respect to [H+]}
\usage{dHAdH\_tri(H, SumA, K1, K2, K3)}
\arguments{
  \item{H }{the proton concentration in a unit consistent with all othert input variables (e.g. mol/kg-solution)}
  \item{SumA }{the total concentration of the acid in question in a unit consistent with all other input variables (e.g. mol/kg-solution)}
  \item{K1 }{the first dissociation constant of the acid in question in a unit consistent with all other input variables (e.g. mol/kg-solution)}
  \item{K2 }{the second dissociation constant of the acid in question in a unit consistent with all other input variables (e.g. mol/kg-solution)}
  \item{K3 }{the third dissociation constant of the acid in question in a unit consistent with all other input variables (e.g. mol/kg-solution)}
