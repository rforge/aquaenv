 - implement the simple equation fitting from Dickson2007: is that the reason for the slight "misfit" between our values and the values of Dickson2007 (TAfit)

 - include flag that allows for objects of class aquaenv without any attributes in their elements
 - add attribute "description" for K's
 - Gran procedure for "first guess" for TA fitting
 
 - add the possibility to add ARBITRARY acids/bases with arbitrary pK's: 
	-> to factor out the effect of various (unknown) organic acids
