Description: Toolbox for the experimental aquatic chemist, focused on 
        acidification and CO2 air-water exchange. It contains all elements to
        model the pH, the related CO2 air-water exchange, and
        aquatic acid-base chemistry for an arbitrary marine,
        estuarine or freshwater system. It contains a suite of tools for 
        sensitivity analysis, visualisation, modelling of chemical batches, 
        and can be used to build dynamic models of aquatic systems. 
        As from version 1.0-4, it also contains functions to calculate 
        the buffer factors.
