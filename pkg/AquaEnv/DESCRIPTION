Description: Toolbox for the experimental aquatic chemist, focused on 
        acidification and CO2 air-water exchange. It contains all elements to
        model the pH, the related CO2 air-water exchange, and
        aquatic acid-base chemistry for an arbitrary marine,
        estuarine or freshwater system. It contains a suite of tools for 
        sensitivity analysis, visualisation, modelling of chemical batches, 
        and can be used to build dynamic models of aquatic systems. 
        As from version 1.1, it also contains functions to calculate 
        the buffer factors. The package is described in two publications:       
        The original publication of the package 
        (http://www.springerlink.com/content/l4747417w0k50463/) and the
        publication describing the expressions implemented in the
        function BufferFactors (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2016.04.012.)
