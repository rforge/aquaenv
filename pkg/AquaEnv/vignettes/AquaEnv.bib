	Abstract = {The transport of excess atmospheric CO2 (defined as the fraction of
	dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) that can escape as CO2 to the atmosphere
	due to water-air equilibration), by the five rivers entering the
	Scheldt estuary is investigated. Excess CO2 originates from both
	respiration in the soil and the river and represents 10 % of the
	DIC and 6 % of the total carbon input into the estuary. The ventilation
	of this CO2 in the estuary is however a minor contribution (10 %)
	to the total estuarine emission to the atmosphere, compared to heterotrophic
	activity and acidification due to nitrification within the estuarine
	zone. (C) 2000 Academie des sciences / Editions scientifiques et

@article{Abril2001,
	Abstract = {We present results of one year observations in highly heterotrophic
	and oxygen-depleted rivers of the polluted Scheldt basin. Monthly
	measurements revealed a high variability for dissolved inorganic
	carbon and nitrogen, with the following strong parallelism: highest
	alkalinity and NH4+ were associated with lowest NO3- and oxygen and
	vice-versa. In river water incubations, nitritication lowered the
	alkalinity whereas denitrification raised it; in an anoxic, NO3-
	-free incubation an increase of alkalinity was observed, partially
	due to ammonification. A stoichiometric analysis, taking into account
	the amount of protons produced or consumed by each process involving
	nitrogen, revealed that monthly variations of NO3- and NH4+ with
	ammonification, nitrification and denitrification could explain the
	28 and 62% alkalinity variations at all stations, except one. The
	remaining part of the alkalinity variations was attributed to other
	anaerobic processes (Mn-, Fe- and SO4-reductions). This trend seems
	to be the result of the whole catchment metabolism (riverine waters
	and sediments, sewage networks and agricultural soils). The observed
	HCO concentrations in the Scheldt basin were 2-10 times higher than
	the representative concentrations reported in pristine basins and
	used in chemical weathering models. This suggests the existence of
	an anthropogenic source, originating From organic matter decomposition.
	We conclude that in highly polluted basins, nitrogen transformations
	strongly influence the acid-base properties of water. (C) 2001 Elsevier

	Abstract = {Calcium carbonate, CaCO3, is one of the most common scale components
	found in oilfield production wells and surface facilities. The prediction
	of kinetics of scale deposit depends on the understanding of the
	CaCO3 precipitation from solution. The formation of CaCO3 is also
	of practical importance in a number of areas such as in paper coatings
	or as fillers for rubber materials.
	
	CaCO3 precipitation studies reported in literature are based on either
	solution properties or using offline size/mass analysis. In the present
	work inline in situ technique is utilised which gives a direct measurement
	of the number and size of crystals. The inline image technique by
	FBRM, Mettler Toledo gives relatively accurate measurements. The
	method of moments was utilised to determine the crystal size and
	hence the growth rate.
	
	The effects of the solution composition on the spontaneous nucleation
	and the crystal growth rate have been examined. From the measurements
	of the crystal growth kinetic data, the crystal growth rates were
	estimated which are found to be an exponential function of calcium
	ion concentration. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Complex networks describe a wide range of systems in nature and society.
	Frequently cited examples include the cell, a network of chemicals

	that motivated the recent interest in networks, the authors discuss
	the main models and analytical tools, covering random graphs, small-world

@article{Altabet1999,
	Abstract = {The nitrogen isotopic composition of time-series sediment trap samples,
	dissolved NO3- and surficial sediments was determined in three regions
	along the margin of the eastern North Pacific: Monterey Bay, San
	Pedro Basin, and the Gulf of California (Carmen and Guaymas Basins).
	Complex physical regimes are present in all three areas, and each
	is influenced seasonally by coastal upwelling. Nevertheless, sediment
	trap material evidently records the isotopic composition of new nitrogen
	sources, since average delta(15)N is generally indistinguishable
	from delta(15)N values for subsurface NO3-. Surficial sediments are
	also very similar to the average delta(15)N value of the sediment
	traps, being within 1 parts per thousand. This difference in delta(15)N
	between trap material and sediment is much less than the previously
	observed 4 parts per thousand, difference for the deep sea. Better
	organic matter preservation at our margin sites is a likely explanation,
	which may be due to either low bottom O-2 concentrations or higher
	organic matter input to the sediments. All sites have delta(15)N
	for sub-euphotic zone NO3- (8-10 parts per thousand) substantially
	elevated from the oceanic average (4.5-5 parts per thousand). This
	isotopic enrichment is a result of denitrification in suboxic subsurface
	waters (Gulf of California) or northward transport of denitrification
	influenced water (Monterey Bay and San Pedro Basin). Our results
	therefore suggest that downcore delta(15)N data, depending on site
	location, would record the intensity of denitrification and the transport
	of its isotopic signature along the California margin. Temporal variations
	in delta(15)N for the sediment traps do appear to respond to upwelling
	or convective injections of NO3- to surface waters as a result of
	isotopic fractionation during phytoplankton uptake. Overall, though,
	the coupling between NO3- injection, delta(15)N, and flux is looser
	than previously observed for the open-ocean, most likely the result
	of the smaller time/space scales of the events. III the Gulf of California,
	wintertime convective mixing/upwelling does produce distinct delta(15)N
	minima co-occurring with particle flux maxima. Interannual variations
	are apparent in this region when these wintertime delta(15)N minima
	fail to occur during El Nino conditions. There appears to be a positive
	relationship between the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) anomaly
	and annual average delta(15)N. One explanation calls for hydrographic
	changes altering the delta(15)N of subeuphotic zone NO3-. (C) 1999

@article{Anderson1994,
	Abstract = {A nonlinear inverse method is applied to nutrient data upon approximately
	20 neutral surfaces in each of the South Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific
	basins, between 400 and 4000 m depth. By accounting for the gradients
	in nutrients due to the mixing of ''preformed'' concentrations of
	the major water masses, the nutrient changes due to biological activity
	are examined, and the time-mean, basin-wide Redfield ratios calculated.
	It is found that the P/N/C(org)/O2 ratios of nutrient regeneration
	between 400 and 4000 m (corrected for the effect of denitrification)
	are approximately constant with depth and basin, at a value of 1/16
	+/- 1/117 +/- 14/170 +/- 10. These ratios agree with those of fresh
	organic matter, suggesting that the flux of organic material to the
	deep ocean may be dominated by fast-sinking matter produced by sporadic,
	high-productivity events. Sedimentary denitrification reduces the
	N/P utilization ratio to 12 +/- 2 between 1000 and 3000 m. In the
	Indian and Pacific basins the C(org)/C(inorg) regeneration ratio
	decreases from approximately 7 +/- 3 at 400 m to 3 +/- 1 at 1000
	m and to 1 +/- 0.5 at 4000 m, suggesting a significant amount of

	Abstract = {Experimental approaches for the identification of functionally important
	regions on the surface of a protein involve mutagenesis, in which
	exposed residues are replaced one after another while the change
	in binding to other proteins or changes in activity are recorded.
	However, practical considerations limit the use of these methods
	to small-scale studies, precluding a full mapping of all the functionally
	important residues on the surface of a protein. We present here an
	alternative approach involving the use of evolutionary data in the
	form of multiple-sequence alignment for a protein family to identify
	hot spots and surface patches that are likely to be in contact with
	other proteins, domains, peptides, DNA, RNA or ligands. The underlying
	assumption in this approach is that key residues that are important
	for binding should be conserved throughout evolution, just like residues
	that are crucial for maintaining the protein fold, i.e. buried residues.
	A main limitation in the implementation of this approach is that
	the sequence space of a protein family may be unevenly sampled, e.g.
	mammals may be overly represented. Thus, a seemingly conserved position
	in the alignment may reflect a taxonomically uneven sampling, rather
	than being indicative of structural or functional importance. To
	avoid this problem, we present here a novel methodology based on
	evolutionary relations among proteins as revealed by inferred phylogenetic
	trees, and demonstrate its capabilities for mapping binding sites
	in SH2 and PTB signaling domains. A computer program that implements

	Abstract = {A transient, vertically resolved, analytical model for the early diagenesis
	of silica has been developed to quantify the importance of benthic-pelagic
	coupling in estuarine biogeochemical silica cycling. A sensitivity
	analysis based on Monte-Carlo simulations is carried out to assess
	the intensity and timing of benthic diffusive fluxes in response
	to a pelagic diatom bloom. The diffusive flux dynamics are analyzed
	over a realistic range of dissolution rate constants (max k(Si)is
	an element of [ 6 x 10(-3)-3(6 x 10(-1) d(-1)]), diffusion coefficients
	of dissolved silica (D-Si is an element of [35 x 10(-6)-35 x 10(-5)
	m(2) d(-1)]) and duration of dissolved silica depletion in the water
	column (w(PDSI) is an element of [1-3 month]). Results show that
	the diffusive silica flux responds with a time delay of 20 to 120
	days to the biogenic silica deposition pulse. For high max k(Si),
	simulated time lags are shortest and completely determined by the
	dissolution kinetics. However, decreasing max kSi leads to a slower
	benthic flux response. In addition, the variability increases due
	to the increasing importance of transport processes. The sensitivity
	study also allows us to constrain the uncertainties of a system-scale
	simulation, where a large number of benthic compartments (> 50 000)
	are coupled to a high-resolution (100 x 100 m) pelagic model of a
	macrotidal river and estuary (Western Scheldt, B/NL). The model is
	applied to a diatom bloom event recorded in 2003, characterized by
	pelagic silica depletion in August. Benthic processes are mainly
	modulated by the combined influence of local hydrodynamic conditions
	and pelagic primary production dynamics, and show therefore a high
	degree of spatial heterogeneity over short distances. Spatially integrated
	deposition fluxes and dissolution rates of biogenic silica are high
	throughout the growth period, with maxima of 1.3 x 10(5) mol d(-1)
	(= 8.0 mmol m(2) d(-1)) and 7.8 x 10(4) mol d(-1) (= 4.8 mmol m(2)
	d(-1)) in mid- August. The spatially integrated diffusive flux reaches
	a maximum of 1.5 x 10(4) mol d(-1) at the end of a pelagic silica
	depletion period in September. However, the total amount of dissolved
	silica released from the estuarine sediments between June and December
	2003 is small (2 x 10(6) mol) compared to the much higher riverine
	influx of dissolved silica (5.9 x 10(7) mol) and plays a minor role
	in the pelagic primary production dynamics.},

	Abstract = {[1] A two-dimensional, nested grid, hydrodynamic, and reactive-transport
	model of the macrotidal Scheldt estuary (B/NL) and its tributaries
	has been developed to identify the driving forces controlling the
	temporal and spatial dynamics of primary production during a summer
	diatom bloom. The hydrodynamic model indicates that energy dissipation
	reaches its maximum 90 km upstream from the mouth, closely followed
	by a minimum farther upstream. Suspended particulate matter (SPM)
	dynamics is simulated to provide the transient light conditions in
	the water column. Results show that the spatial distribution of SPM
	mirrors closely the profile of energy dissipation. The temporal SPM
	dynamics is highly sensitive to fluctuations in river discharge,
	whose influence decreases downstream. Peaks in SPM are triggered
	by high discharges and can be recorded as far as 50 km seaward of
	the upstream model boundary. Results from the phytoplankton model
	demonstrate the fast response of diatom growth to changes in the
	physical environment, especially those due to daily variations in
	river discharge which continuously modify the SPM concentrations
	and residence times. Episodes of persistent low flow conditions lead
	to a progressive depletion of dissolved silica. Simulated diatom
	growth becomes increasingly controlled by silica availability, until
	primary production collapses. The spatiotemporal evolution of primary
	production is explored over the entire domain of forcing conditions.
	The distribution of the daily maximum of net primary production and
	its location reveal that four different system states can be identified
	in the forcing planes. The transition from one state to the other
	characterizes the diatom growth response in the estuary.},

	Abstract = {Therapeutic success of anti-HIV therapies is limited by the development
	of drug resistant viruses. These genetic variants display complex
	mutational patterns in their pol gene, which codes for protease and
	reverse transcriptase, the molecular targets of current antiretroviral
	therapy. Genotypic resistance testing depends on the ability to interpret
	such sequence data, whereas phenotypic resistance testing directly
	measures relative in vitro susceptibility to a drug. From a set of
	650 matched genotype-phenotype pairs we construct regression models
	for the prediction of phenotypic drug resistance from genotypes.
	Since the range of resistance factors varies considerably between
	different drugs, two scoring functions are derived from different
	sets of predicted phenotypes. Firstly, we compare predicted values
	to those of samples derived from 178 treatment-naive patients and
	report the relative deviance. Secondly, estimation of the probability
	density of 2000 predicted phenotypes gives rise to an intrinsic definition
	of a susceptible and a resistant subpopulation. Thus, for a predicted
	phenotype, we calculate the probability of membership in the resistant
	subpopulation. Both scores provide standardized measures of resistance
	that can be calculated from the genotype and are comparable between
	drugs. The geno2pheno system makes these genotype interpretations
	available via the Internet (http://www.genafor.org/).},

	management of HIV type 1 infected patients. Whereas phenotypic assays
	directly measure drug resistance, the commonly used genotypic assays
	provide only indirect evidence of drug resistance, the major challenge
	being the interpretation of the sequence information. We analyzed
	the significance of sequence variations in the protease and reverse
	transcriptase genes for drug resistance and derived models that predict
	phenotypic resistance from genotypes. For 14 antiretroviral drugs,
	both genotypic and phenotypic resistance data from 471 clinical isolates
	were analyzed with a machine learning approach. Information profiles
	were obtained that quantify the statistical significance of each
	sequence position for drug resistance. For the different drugs, patterns
	of varying complexity were observed, including between one and nine
	sequence positions with substantial information content. Based on
	these information profiles, decision tree classifiers were generated
	to identify genotypic patterns characteristic of resistance or susceptibility
	to the different drugs. We obtained concise and easily interpretable
	models to predict drug resistance from sequence information. The
	prediction quality of the models was assessed in leave-one-out experiments

	Abstract = {[1] The global CaCO3 budget is constrained by new estimates of standing
	stocks, fluxes through the water column, and dissolution in the water
	column and on the sea floor. Previous estimates of carbonate production
	and export are indistinguishable within a large range of values,
	0.4 - 1.8 Gt PIC yr(-1). Globally, excess alkalinity (TA*) and water
	mass tracers indicate dissolution of 1.0 Gt PIC yr(-1) between 200
	and 1500 m, suggesting production and export must at least equal
	this amount. Most water column dissolution occurs at high latitudes,
	and alkalinity fluxes from outer shelf and upper slope sediments
	( 100 - 1500 m) only support 5 - 10% of the TA* inventory. Below
	2000 m, the sinking flux of PIC (0.6 Gt PIC yr(-1)) is consistent
	with the rate of sea floor dissolution (0.4 Gt PIC yr(-1)) plus burial
	(0.1 Gt PIC yr(-1)). This rain rate constrains the export value to
	> 1.6 Gt PIC yr(-1). Satellite-based estimates of standing stocks
	of CaCO3 indicate a decrease equatorward, which is opposite in trend
	to sediment trap fluxes. This observation may be explained by an
	equatorward decrease in sinking particle dissolution, systematic
	changes in PIC residence time with latitude, or satellite retrieval
	problems. Globally averaged euphotic zone standing stock (5.4 mmol
	m(-2)) and export estimates indicate PIC residence times of 5 - 18

	Abstract = {This paper examines the effect of oxygen on nitrous oxide (N2O) concentrations
	in estuarine waters. N2O has been measured year-round in the Schelde
	estuary, a high-nitrogen, low-oxygen macrotidal system. N2O concentrations
	were above atmospheric equilibrium levels indicating that this estuary
	represents a source to the atmosphere. The distribution of N2O showed
	consistent and systematic relationships with distribution patterns
	of ammonium, oxygen, nitrite and nitrification activities. A controlled
	laboratory experiment with a natural bacterial community from the
	Schelde estuary revealed maximum N2O production to occur at oxygen
	concentrations of about 5 muM. This production was inhibited by acetylene,
	a nitrification inhibitor. Maximum N2O concentration in the field
	occurred at oxygen concentrations below 35 muM. The difference in
	the oxygen concentration that results in maximum N2O may have arisen
	because low-oxygen environments present in the estuary were destroyed
	by stirring in our laboratory experiment. It appears that low oxygen
	concentrations in estuarine water trigger enhanced N2O production
	if ammonium is present in sufficient amounts. This conclusion is

	used to simulate the temporal and spatial variability in pH across
	the southern North Sea as it relates to the environmental and biological
	processes affecting CO2, namely, photosynthesis and respiration,
	riverine boundary conditions and atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
	Annual pH ranges are found to vary from < 0.2 in areas of low biological
	activity to > 1.0 in areas influenced by riverine signals, consistent
	with observations and previous studies. It is shown that benthic,
	as well as pelagic, activity is an important factor in this variability.
	The acidification of the region due to increased fluxes of atmospheric
	CO2 into the marine system is calculated and shown to exceed, on
	average, 0.1 pH units over the next 50 years and result in a total
	acidification of 0.5 pH units below pre-industrial levels at atmospheric
	CO2 concentrations of 1000 ppm. The potential for measurable changes
	in biogeochemistry are demonstrated by simulating the observed inhibition
	of pelagic nitrification with decreasing pH. However, we conclude
	that there is a lack of knowledge of how acidification might affect
	the complex interaction of processes that govern marine biogeochemical
	cycles and a consequent need for further research and observations.

	The differences of the y-intercept and the slope between the three

	Abstract = {We compiled from literature annually integrated air-water fluxes of
	carbon dioxide (CO2) computed from field measurements, in 20 coastal
	European environments that were gathered into 3 main ecosystems:
	inner estuaries, upwelling continental shelves and non-upwelling
	continental shelves. The comparison of annual cycles of the partial
	pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) in 5 contrasting continental shelves provided
	insights into the biogeochemical drivers of the CO2 fluxes. The latter
	were also investigated by comparing CO2 fluxes to net ecosystem (NEP)
	and net community production (NCP) in 3 contrasted coastal ecosystems.
	Air-water CO2 fluxes were scaled at European regional level and compared
	to fluxes of atmospheric CO2 in other aquatic and terrestrial compartments.
	Continental shelves are significant sinks for atmospheric CO2 at
	an average rate of -1.9 molC m(-2) yr(-1) that scaled at European
	level corresponds to an absorption of atmospheric CO2 of -68.1 TgC
	yr(-1). This sink is equivalent to the one reported for the terrestrial
	biosphere of -66.1 TgC yr(-1), based on carbon-stock change models.
	Estuaries are significant sources of CO2 to the atmosphere at an
	average rate of 49.9 molC m(-2) yr(-1) that is higher than the CO2
	emission to the atmosphere from rivers, streams and lakes. The scaled
	emission of CO2 to the atmosphere from inner estuaries of about 67.0
	TgC yr(-1) would almost fully balance the sink of atmospheric CO2
	computed for continental shelves. However, the scaled emission of
	CO2 from estuaries to the atmosphere is inconsistent with the potential
	emission of CO2 based on the fate of river organic carbon during
	estuarine transit. This discrepancy is most probably due to the poorly
	constrained surface area estimate of inner estuaries. (c) 2006 Elsevier

	Neuse River estuary, North Carolina, a shallow, intermittently-mixed
	estuary using approximately 10 years of weekly/biweekly, mid-channel
	data. A generalized additive model (GAM) was used to initially explore
	the major relationships among observed variables. The results of
	this statistical model guided the specification of a process-based
	model of oxygen dynamics that is consistent with theory pet simple
	enough to be parameterized using available field data. The nonlinear
	optimization procedure employed allows for the direct estimation
	of microbial oxygen consumption and physical reoxygenation rates,
	including the effects of temperature and vertical stratification.
	These estimated rates may better represent aggregate system behaviour
	than closed chamber measurements made in the laboratory and in situ.
	The resulting model describes 79% of the variation in dissolved oxygen
	concentration and is robust when compared across separate locations
	and time periods. Model predictions suggest that the spatial extent
	and duration of hypoxia in the bottom waters of the Neuse are controlled
	by the balance between the net oxygen depletion rate and the frequency
	of vertical mixing events. During cool months, oxygen consumption
	rates remain low enough to keep oxygen concentration well above levels
	of concern even under extended periods of stratification. A concentration
	below 4 mg 1(-1) is only expected under extended periods without
	vertical mixing when bottom water temperature exceeds 15 degreesC,
	while a concentration below 2 mg 1(-1) is only expected when water
	temperature exceeds 20 degreesC. To incorporate thr effects of parameter
	uncertainty, model error, and natural variability on model prediction,
	we used Monte Carlo simulation to generate distributions for the

	expected number of days with a dissolved oxygen concentration less

	Abstract = {A diagenetic model is presented that describes the effects of the
	steady-state reaction between oxygen and sulfide on pH distributions
	in porewaters. The model includes consumption of O2 and sulfide and
	the production of H+ by this oxidation reaction, fast association-dissociation
	reactions in the dissolved carbonate and sulfide systems, and separate
	diffusive transport of each of these solute species. Two mathematical
	forms for the oxidation kinetics are examined. The first is a nonlinear
	product of the oxygen and total sulfide concentrations, and the second
	is a spatially dependent sink in the form of a Gaussian function.
	This model is applied to the data obtained by and (1983) in a Beggiatoa
	mat. Approximate numerical solution of the model with nonlinear kinetics
	shows that the oxygen and total sulfide profiles can be fit simultaneously
	with an oxidation rate constant of the order of 1015 M-1 a-1. The
	best simulation to the associated pH profile is obtained by assuming
	a [Sigma]CO2 concentration of about 1.8 mM. This predicted profile
	agrees with the general shape and magnitude of the observed pH change;
	however, the calculated pH minimum is sharper than that seen in the
	data. Adoption of Gaussian kinetics leads to an analytical solution
	of the model, from which it is relatively easy to generate species
	profiles. With Gaussian kinetics, the model also predicts pH profiles
	similar to those observed except for the acuity of the minimum. The
	results of both kinetic models show that porewaters become rapidly
	undersaturated with respect to calcite. The best fit to the observed
	pH profile is obtained by reacting the oxygen and sulfide along a
	distinct interface in the sediments, while releasing the H+ byproduct
	of this reaction over a zone of nonzero thickness. This finding could
	be attributed to the biological nature of the oxidation reaction
	in which Beggiatoa attempt to consume reactants at a discrete depth
	to optimize the energy yield, but expel products on a larger scale
	due to the mobility of this organism and because there is no particular
	advantage in releasing the products at a distinct interface.},

	Abstract = {We compare the theoretical predictions of a closed- and an open-system
	model for the evolution of pH and calcite-saturation state during
	the sequential oxidation of organic matter by O2, NO3-, and SO4=.
	The closed-system model is similar to previous thermodynamic models
	found in the geochemical literature (e.g., BEN-YAAKOV, 1973). The
	open-system model allows for differential diffusion of dissolved
	species, exchange with overlying waters, fast acid/base reactions,
	and a variety of spatially distributed sources and sinks. In particular,
	dissolution and precipitation of minerals are included either as
	local equilibrium processes as in the case of calcite dissolution,
	or as depth-dependent exponentials as for FeS and CaCO3 Precipitation.
	
	The model calculations reveal that closed and open systems have qualitatively
	similar behavior with respect to pH and carbonate saturation, OMEGA(c).
	However, a quantitative comparison establishes that the closed-system
	model represents usually an upper limit on pH in the oxic zone of
	sediments, while it always sets a lower bound on pH in the zone of
	SO4= reduction. The changes in OMEGA(c) in closed and open systems
	during oxic decay are more complex than those of pH. The closed system
	will present an upper limit on OMEGA(c) when the initial pH is high
	(i.e., 8.0), but does not exhibit limiting behavior if the initial
	pH is low (i.e., 7.0). The closed-system model always places a lower
	limit on OMEGA(c) during sulfate reduction.
	
	Both models predict that CaCO3 dissolution can buffer the potential
	pH fall due to oxic CO2 production; however, quantitative evaluation
	of this effect requires a diagenetic model with realistic dissolution
	kinetics. Our investigations also demonstrate that vigorous mono-sulfide
	precipitation from an FeOOH-iron source can mitigate the fall in
	pH normally associated with organic matter decay as this mineral-forming
	reaction consumes an important protolytic species, H2S. On the other
	hand, the precipitation of CaCO3 has only a modest lowering effect
	on pH.
	
	The oxidation of total dissolved ammonia and sulfide by O2 represents
	a potentially strong source of protons. Counter-intuitively, such
	oxidation reactions at the base of the oxic layer will raise the
	pH at a given O2 concentration because of a concomitant decrease
	in the O2-penetration depth. In addition, the O2 demand of the sediments
	can switch almost entirely from organic matter decay to reduced byproduct
	oxidation as the amount of sulfate reduction increases. Byproducts
	oxidation leads, however, to lower calcite-saturation states, and
	this can lead to more dissolution of fossil material near the sediment-water
	interface.},

	Abstract = {The River Seine downstream from Paris receives large amounts of ammonium
	(about 200 mu mol/l) from treated and untreated wastewater effluents.
	In such large river systems, due to the slow growth of nitrifying
	bacteria, the small size of the nitrifying population present in
	the water column often represents the limiting factor for nitrification
	of the contaminating ammonium. In this work we demonstrate that discharge
	of urban effluents can represent an important seeding of nitrifying
	bacteria, influencing the dynamics of nitrification in the river
	downstream. A nitrifying bacteria biomass in wastewater was deduced
	from (HCO3-)-C-14 potential nitrifying activity measurements. these

	in treated effluents (0.8-30 mu gC/1) than in the receiving river
	water (0.5-5 mu gC/1). a retrospective analysis of the nitrification
	process in the River Seine downstream from Paris suggests that the
	overall ammonium oxidation rate has been continuously reduced over
	the past 20 years (from 1.5 to 1.0 mu mol/l/h), as a result of the

	Abstract = {Current aquatic ecosystem models accommodate increasing amounts of

	aggregating multitudes of different species. We propose that at present,
	understanding of aquatic ecosystems is likely to benefit more from
	improved descriptions of biodiversity and succession than from incorporation
	of more realistic physiology. To illustrate how biodiversity can
	be accounted for, we define the system of infinite diversity ( SID),
	which characterizes ecosystems in the spirit of complex adaptive
	systems theory as single units adapting to environmental pressure.
	The SID describes an ecosystem with one generic population model
	and continuity in species- characterizing parameters, and acquires
	rich dynamics by modeling succession as evolution of the parameter
	value distribution. This is illustrated by a four- parameter phytoplankton
	model that minimizes physiological detail, but includes a sophisticated
	representation of community diversity and interspecific differences.
	This model captures several well- known aquatic ecosystem features,
	including formation of a deep chlorophyll maximum and nutrient- driven
	seasonal succession. As such, it integrates theories on changes in

	Abstract = {The Zhu-jiang (Pearl River) estuary and its adjacent continental shelf
	in the Northern South China Sea (SCS) is unique in that its drainage
	basin is located entirely in a subtropical zone with heavy population
	development, and therefore represents an important regime for biogeochemical
	studies on how large rivers influence continental shelves. The near-zero
	salinity end member has high nutrient concentrations (silicate 130-140
	muM, nitrate 75-100 muM and phosphate 0.2-1.2 muM) and relatively
	high total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) (1500 muM) and alkalinity
	(similar to1650 muM) values. Water column DIC, alkalinity, and nutrient
	in the estuary are largely controlled by mixing of waters from different
	tributaries with different drainage basin chemistry, anthropogenic
	influence, and degree of estuarine recycling. Biological uptake of
	nutrients and inorganic carbon occur in the outer estuary and inner
	shelf areas supported by riverine nutrients. The N/P and Si/P ratios
	are generally very high within the estuary. The summertime area-integrated
	biological production rate of 0.8 gCm(-2) d(-1) is estimated based
	on the depletion of DIC and alkalinity relative to the conservative
	mixing line and a plume travel time. This estimate agrees reasonably
	well with C-14 based primary production rates (PP) and with that
	from effective river phosphate flux. Biological production decreases
	about 10-fold in the open continental shelf and slope and is largely
	supported by mixing with subsurface water. A comparison of DIC, phosphate,
	and nitrate concentrations in the surface mixing layer and at the
	bottom of the euphotic zone with the C-14-based PP (0.13 gCm(-2)d(-1))
	suggests that the surface water residence time in the Northern SCS
	is similar to1.3 years. The N/P, Si/P, and Si/C ratios are 15, 25,
	and 0.15, respectively. The subtropical Pearl River study is also
	compared to other large rivers with regard to differences in both
	natural processes (i.e., weathering rates) and anthropogenic influences
	(i.e., nutrient input) between these different river estuary systems.

	Abstract = {The pH, alkalinity (Alk), and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in
	estuarine waters of several rivers of Georgia in the southeastern
	United States are reported. Although they discharge into a narrow
	area in the South Atlantic Eight, the rivers along the coast of Georgia
	differ significantly in their drainage area (piedmont rivers vs.
	coastal plain rivers), chemical composition (contents of carbonate
	and humics), and discharge rates. Large differences in pH, DIG, and
	Alk between these rivers clearly reflect the differences of material
	inputs to the rivers. Dramatic pH increases in the early stage of
	mixing (more obvious for the coastal plain rivers) reflect the low
	buffering capacity of the river waters despite the high content of
	humic substances. Flux of riverine DIC to the South Atlantic Eight
	is estimated to be 52.5 X 10(9) mol yr(-1). We suggest that the presently
	available world total riverine DIC flux to the ocean could have much
	uncertainty if the small river fluxes are important. Calculated pCO(2)

	Abstract = {Regime shifts are large, long-lasting changes in ecosystems. They
	are often hard to predict but may have leading indicators which are
	detectable in advance. Potential leading indicators include wider
	swings in dynamics of key ecosystem variables, slower return rates
	after perturbation and shift of variance towards lower frequencies.
	We evaluated these indicators using a food web model calibrated to
	long-term whole-lake experiments. We investigated whether impending
	regime shifts driven by gradual increase in exploitation of the top
	predator can create signals that cascade through food webs and be
	discerned in phytoplankton. Substantial changes in standard deviations,
	return rates and spectra occurred near the switch point, even two
	trophic levels removed from the regime shift in fishes. Signals of
	regime shift can be detected well in advance, if the driver of the
	regime shift changes much more slowly than the dynamics of key ecosystem
	variables which can be sampled frequently enough to measure the indicators.
	However, the regime shift may occur long after the driver has passed
	the critical point, because of very slow transient dynamics near
	the critical point. Thus, the ecosystem can be poised for regime
	shift by the time the signal is discernible. Field tests are needed
	to evaluate these indicators.},

	Abstract = {We report a novel method for measurement of the oxygen isotopic composition
	(O-18/O-16) of nitrate (NO3-) from both seawater and freshwater.
	The denitrifier method, based on the isotope ratio analysis of nitrous
	oxide generated from sample nitrate by cultured denitrifying bacteria,
	has been described elsewhere for its use in nitrogen isotope ratio
	(N-15/N-14) analysis of nitrate.(1) Here, we address the additional
	issues associated with O-18/O-16 analysis of nitrate by this approach,
	which include (1) the oxygen isotopic difference between the nitrate
	sample and the N2O analyte due to isotopic fractionation associated
	with the loss of oxygen atoms from nitrate and (2) the exchange of
	oxygen atoms with water during the conversion of nitrate to N2O.
	Experiments with O-18-labeled water indicate that water exchange
	contributes less than 10%, and frequently less than 3%, of the oxygen
	atoms in the N2O product for Pseudomonas aureofaciens. In addition,
	both oxygen isotope fractionation and oxygen atom exchange are consistent
	within a given batch of analyses. The analysis of appropriate isotopic
	reference materials can thus be used to correct the measured O-18/O-16
	ratios of samples for both effects. This is the first method tested
	for O-18/O-16 analysis of nitrate in seawater. Benefits of this method,
	relative to published freshwater methods, include higher sensitivity
	(tested down to 10 nmol and 1 muM NO3-), lack of interference by
	other solutes, and ease of sample preparation.},

	in the sediments on the continental shelves do generate alkalinity

	Abstract = {The dissolution of aragonite particles in the ocean primarily depends
	on the degree of undersaturation of seawater with respect to that
	mineral. Most of the upper Atlantic Ocean, particularly north of
	30degreesS and at depths of less than 2000 m, is supersaturated with
	respect to aragonite, whereas much of the deep Atlantic is undersaturated.
	Here we report, for the first time, shallow layers of aragonite-undersaturated
	water between 20degreesS and 15degreesN in the eastern tropical Atlantic.
	These layers are centered at 800 m and are surrounded by aragonite-supersaturated
	water above and below. This feature most likely results from a combination
	of chemical and biological processes including the uptake of anthropogenic
	CO2 and the oxidation of organic matter falling from the highly productive
	overlying surface water. Reaction with protons resulting from these
	processes decreases the carbonate ion concentration and consequently
	the saturation state of the waters with respect to aragonite. The
	oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2 during the industrial era has
	caused a significant increase in the size of the undersaturated layers.
	Future expansion will likely occur laterally to the west and south,
	where the degree of supersaturation is low compared to waters to
	the north. This expansion of the undersaturated layers is a prime
	example of how human activity during the industrial era has altered
	the upper ocean chemistry by injecting fossil fuel CO2 into the ocean.},

	Abstract = {Side-chain or even backbone adjustments upon docking of different
	ligands to the same protein structure, a phenomenon known as induced
	fit, are frequently observed. Sometimes point mutations within the
	active site influence the ligand binding of proteins. Furthermore,
	for homology derived protein structures there are often ambiguities
	in side-chain placement and uncertainties in loop modeling which
	may be critical for docking applications. Nevertheless, only very
	few molecular docking approaches have taken into account such variations
	in protein structures.We present the new software tool FlexE which
	addresses the problem of protein structure variations during docking
	calculations. FlexE can dock flexible ligands into an ensemble of
	protein structures which represents the flexibility, point mutations,
	or alternative models of a protein. The FlexE approach is based on
	a united protein description generated from the superimposed structures
	of the ensemble. For varying parts of the protein, discrete alternative
	conformations are explicitly taken into account, which can be combinatorially
	joined to create new valid protein structures.FlexE was evaluated
	using ten protein structure ensembles containing 105 crystal structures
	from the PDB and one modeled structure with 60 ligands in total.
	For 50 ligands (83 %) FlexE finds a placement with an RMSD to the
	crystal structure below 2.0 A. In all cases our results are of similar
	quality to the best solution obtained by sequentially docking the
	ligands into all protein structures (cross docking). In most cases
	the computing time is significantly lower than the accumulated run
	times for the single structures. FlexE takes about five and a half
	minutes on average for placing one ligand into the united protein
	description on a common workstation.The example of the aldose reductase
	demonstrates the necessity of considering protein structure variations
	for docking calculations. We docked three potent inhibitors into
	four protein structures with substantial conformational changes within
	the active site. Using only one rigid protein structure for screening
	would have missed potential inhibitors whereas all inhibitors can

	Abstract = {A primary focus of coastal science during the past 3 decades has been
	the question: How does anthropogenic nutrient enrichment cause change
	in the structure or function of nearshore coastal ecosystems? This
	theme of environmental science is recent, so our conceptual model
	of the coastal eutrophication problem continues to change rapidly.
	In this review, I suggest that the early (Phase I) conceptual model
	was strongly influenced by Limnologists, who began intense study
	of lake eutrophication by the 1960s. The Phase I model emphasized
	changing nutrient input as a signal. and responses to that signal
	as increased phytoplankton biomass and primary production, decomposition
	of phytoplankton-derived organic matter, and enhanced depletion of
	oxygen from bottom waters. Coastal research in recent decades has
	identified key differences in the responses of lakes and coastal-estuarine
	ecosystems to nutrient enrichment, The contemporary (Phase II) conceptual
	model reflects those differences and includes explicit recognition
	of (1) system-specific attributes that act as a filter to modulate
	the responses to enrichment (leading to large differences among estuarine-coastal
	systems in their sensitivity to nutrient enrichment); and (2) a complex
	suite of direct and indirect responses including linked changes in:
	water transparency, distribution of vascular plants and biomass of
	macroalgae, sediment biogeochemistry and nutrient cycling, nutrient
	ratios and their regulation of phytoplankton community composition,
	frequency of toxic/harmful algal blooms, habitat quality for metazoans,
	reproduction/growth/survival of pelagic and benthic invertebrates,
	and subtle changes such as shifts in the seasonality of ecosystem
	functions. Each aspect of the Phase II model is illustrated here
	with examples from coastal ecosystems around the world. In the last
	section of this review I present one vision of the next (Phase III)
	stage in the evolution of our conceptual model, organized around
	5 questions that will guide coastal science in the early 21st century:
	(1) How do system-specific attributes constrain or amplify the responses
	of coastal ecosystems to nutrient enrichment? (2) How does nutrient
	enrichment interact with other stressors (toxic contaminants, fishing
	harvest, aquaculture, nonindigenous species, habitat loss, climate
	change, hydrologic manipulations) to change coastal ecosystems? (3)
	How are responses to multiple stressors linked? (4) How does human-induced
	change in the coastal zone impact the Earth system as habitat for
	humanity and other species? (5) How can a deeper scientific understanding
	of the coastal eutrophication problem be applied to develop tools
	for building strategies at ecosystem restoration or rehabilitation?},

	of background and anthropogenically altered sources, on the order
	of 1.9&nbsp;Pg&nbsp;C&nbsp;y−1 from the terrestrial landscape,
	of which about 0.2 is buried in aquatic sediments, at least 0.8 (possibly
	much more) is returned to the atmosphere as gas exchange while the
	remaining 0.9&nbsp;Pg&nbsp;y−1 is delivered to the oceans, roughly
	equally as inorganic and organic carbon. Thus, roughly twice as much
	C enters inland aquatic systems from land as is exported from land
	to the sea. Over prolonged time net carbon fluxes in aquatic systems
	tend to be greater per unit area than in much of the surrounding
	land. Although their area is small, these freshwater aquatic systems
	can affect regional C balances. Further, the inclusion of inland,
	freshwater ecosystems provides useful insight about the storage,
	oxidation and transport of terrestrial C, and may warrant a revision
	of how the modern net C sink on land is described.},

	Abstract = {In physiological studies of marine phytoplankton in culture, the CO2
	equilibrium is typically calculated from measurement of PHNBS (calibrated
	in dilute National Bureau of Standards buffers) and a single point
	titration of alkalinity (A(T)) This approach has widespread appeal
	because it is simple, inexpensive, and requires very low sample volumes.
	However, its continued application ignores advances in analytical
	and theoretical oceanic CO2 chemistry that suggest fundamental flaws
	in the assumption PHNBS = -log[H+] as a consequence of the high ionic
	strength of seawater and liquid residual junction errors in the electrode.
	Here we compare directly measured pCO(2) in sterile artificial seawater
	with calculated values, adopting the usual assumptions and commonly
	used equilibrium constants. Calculated values either overestimated
	(ca +15 to +23 % error) or underestimated (-9 to -11% error) directly
	measured pCO(2) depending upon whether constants were derived, respectively,
	on the PHNBS Or 'seawater' (PHSWS) scales. With the currently accepted
	equilibrium constants on the 'total hydrogen ion' pH scale (PHTOT),
	and converting PHNBS to PHSWS using an apparent activity coefficient
	f(H) (optimum value 0.85) and then to PHTOT, excellent agreement
	was achieved between calculated and measured pCO(2), both in sterile
	seawater and in cultures of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana.
	However, f(H) is generally unknown and is specific to electrode and
	electrode condition, making calculated pCO(2) a rather nebulous concept.
	Without knowledge of f(H), calculated pCO(2) had a total uncertainty
	of an order (similar to 120 ppmv at atmospheric equilibrium 360 ppmv)
	similar to the variation in atmospheric pCO(2) between glacial periods
	and the present (similar to 160 ppmv). This method therefore clearly
	lacks the resolution required to address the biogeochemical significance
	of key physiological questions. Future studies should measure pCO(2)
	directly, and then if required calculate CO2(aq) from pCO(2) and
	the solubility coefficient. Alternatively, since analytical precision
	of calculated pCO(2) was excellent, and accuracy is potentially good
	when f(H) is known, we advocate improved interdisciplinary collaboration
	in order to improve this pH & AT approach as a simple but effective
	tool for the study of marine phytoplankton physiology under controlled
	conditions.},

	detailed mechanisms are still unclear. This review summarizes what
	is known about the interactions between calcite precipitation and
	the autotrophic picoplankton. We consider findings from both field
	and laboratory studies. Field studies show that calcite precipitation
	in oligotrophic lakes is strongly linked with picocyanobacteria blooms.
	Laboratory experiments led to the formulation of the mechanism of
	precipitation induced by microalga. Experiments also showed that
	precipitation induced by picocyanobacteria is influenced by various
	factors including the uptake of inorganic carbon and the structure
	of the cell walls. Recent studies indicate that the influence of
	environmental conditions like the composition of lake water has to
	be taken into account as well. We conclude that in situ observations

	Abstract = {Fossil fuel combustion and agriculture result in atmospheric deposition

	and open ocean near major source regions in North America, Europe,
	and South and East Asia. Atmospheric inputs of dissociation products
	of strong acids (HNO3 and H2SO4) and bases (NH3) alter surface seawater
	alkalinity, pH, and inorganic carbon storage. We quantify the biogeochemical
	impacts by using atmosphere and ocean models. The direct acid/base
	flux to the ocean is predominately acidic (reducing total alkalinity)
	in the temperate Northern Hemisphere and alkaline in the tropics
	because of ammonia inputs. However, because most of the excess ammonia
	is nitrified to nitrate (NO[IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0">)
	in the upper ocean, the effective net atmospheric input is acidic
	almost everywhere. The decrease in surface alkalinity drives a net
	airsea efflux of CO2, reducing surface dissolved inorganic carbon
	(DIC); the alkalinity and DIC changes mostly offset each other, and
	the decline in surface pH is small. Additional impacts arise from
	nitrogen fertilization, leading to elevated primary production and
	biological DIC drawdown that reverses in some places the sign of
	the surface pH and airsea CO2 flux perturbations. On a global scale,
	the alterations in surface water chemistry from anthropogenic nitrogen
	and sulfur deposition are a few percent of the acidification and
	DIC increases due to the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO2. However,
	the impacts are more substantial in coastal waters, where the ecosystem

	the precision and accuracy of the in situ total gas and oxygen measurements
	and to assess their utility for remotely determining net biological
	oxygen production in the euphotic zone. By calibrating the oxygen
	sensor approximately every month during periodic visits to the mooring
	it was possible to remotely measure the time history of the partial
	pressures of nitrogen and oxygen to within +/-0.5% accuracy as assessed
	by independent determination of nitrogen concentration. Oxygen changed
	at 50 in by 2-4% in a series of episodes with durations of 1-3 months,
	indicating the discontinuous nature of net O-2 production and the
	probable decoupling of oxygen production and respiration in the euphotic
	zone. The GTD and oxygen measurements together can be used to distinguish
	the effects of physical processes and net biological oxygen production
	on the oxygen concentrations. The largest uncertainty in the coupled
	O-2 and total gas pressure measurements is the drift of the oxygen
	sensor, making frequent calibration presently a necessity. With more
	complete vertical coverage in the upper ocean it should be possible
	to use this approach to determine depth-integrated net oxygen production
	in the euphotic zone and upper thermocline respiration. (C) 2002

	The advantage of substitute equations is that they enable index reduction
	and consistent initialization of higher index DAEs without changing
	the original equations; no existing variables are removed and no
	new variables are introduced. Substitute equations can also be used
	to enable the use of general purpose numerical solvers for equations

	Abstract = {The subduction of carbon is examined using abiotic models of the solubility
	pump in the subtropical gyre of the North Atlantic. The importance
	of the seasonal cycle of the mixed layer, and advection of carbon,
	is examined using sensitivity experiments with a Lagrangian model
	of the carbon system. The rate of subduction of carbon is found to
	be strongly influenced by the gradients in mixed-layer thickness
	over the gyre and, to a lesser extent, modified by the end of winter
	bias in the properties of subducted fluid.
	
	A seasonally-cycling geochemical model of the carbon system is then
	developed for the North Atlantic. The model is diagnosed to examine
	the seasonal exchange in carbon between the atmosphere and ocean
	induced by the seasonal warming and cooling. There is a net annual
	air-sea flux of carbon into the subtropical gyre of the model due
	to undersaturation of p(CO2) with respect to the local equilibrium
	with the atmosphere. The undersaturation is due to advection of carbon
	by the circulation. Along the path of the Gulf Stream, northward
	advection and cooling of the low latitude waters is so rapid that
	the surface waters are significantly undersaturated in carbon. Due
	to its long equilibration period, there is a resultant air-sea flux
	of carbon dioxide over the northern flank and interior of the subtropical
	gyre. Warm, low carbon water from the tropics is fluxed into the
	southern flank of the subtropical gyre in the Ekman layer, inducing
	an oceanic uptake of carbon there. The model experiments suggest
	that it is necessary to account for advection to close the carbon
	budget in the observed time-series measurements at Bermuda.},

	Abstract = {Planktonic gross primary production (GPP), community respiration (CR),
	and nitrification (NIT) were measured monthly in the Scheldt estuary
	by the oxygen incubation method in 2003. No significant evolution
	of planktonic GPP was observed since the 1990s with high rates in
	the freshwater area (salinity 0; 97 +/- 65 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) decreasing
	seaward (22-37 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)). A significant decrease of NIT
	was observed with regard to previous investigations although this
	process still represents up to 20% of total organic matter production
	in the inner estuary. Planktonic CR was highest in the inner estuary
	and seemed to be mainly controlled by external organic matter inputs.
	Planktonic net community production was negative most of the time
	in the estuary with values ranging from -300 to 165 mmol C m(-2)
	d(-1). Whole estuary net ecosystem production (NEP) was investigated
	on an annual scale using the results mentioned above and published
	benthic metabolic rates. A NEP of -39 +/- 8 mmol C m(-2) d(-1) was
	estimated, which confirms the strong heterotrophic status of this
	highly nutrified estuary. NEP rates were computed from June to December
	2003 to compare with results derived from the Land-Ocean Interaction
	in the Coastal Zone budgeting procedure applied to dissolved inorganic
	phosphorus and carbon (DIP and DIC). DIP budgets failed to provide
	realistic estimates in the inner estuary where abiotic processes
	account for more than 50% of the nonconservative DIP flux. DIC budgets
	predicted a much lower NEP than in situ incubations (-109 +/- 31
	versus -42 +/- 9 mmol C m(-1) d(-1)) although, as each approach is
	associated with several critical assumptions, the source of this
	discrepancy remains unclear.},

	(O-2-LD), (2) C-14 incorporation and (3) O-18 labeling. Estimates

	Ratios of O-2-LD to O-18-based rates (range: 0.99 to 3.54) were often

@article{Gazeau2004,
	Abstract = {The geomorphic, oceanographic, terrestrial and anthropogenic attributes
	of the European coastal zone are described and published data on
	ecosystem function (primary production and respiration) are reviewed.
	Four regions are considered: the Baltic Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Black
	Sea and the European Atlantic coast including the North Sea. The
	metabolic database (194 papers) suffers from a non-homogeneous geographical
	coverage with no usable data for the Black Sea which was therefore
	excluded from this part of our study. Pelagic gross primary production
	in European open shelves is, by far, the most documented parameter
	with an estimated mean of 41 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), the lowest value
	is reported in the Mediterranean Sea (21 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)) and
	the highest one in the Atlantic/North Sea area (51 mmol C m(-2) d(-1)).
	Microphytobenthic primary production, mostly measured in shallow
	areas, is extrapolated to the entire 0-200 m depth range. Its contribution
	to total primary production is low in all regions (mean: 1.5 mmol
	C m(-2) d(-1)). Although macrophyte beds are very productive, a regional
	production estimate is not provided in this study because their geographical
	distribution along the European coastline remains unknown. Measurements
	of pelagic community respiration are clearly too sparse, especially
	below the euphotic zone, to yield an accurate picture of the fate
	of organic matter produced in the water column. With a mean value
	of 17 mmol C m(-2) d(-1), benthic community respiration consumes
	approximately 40% of the pelagic organic matter production. Estuaries
	generally exhibit high metabolic rates and a large range of variation
	in all parameters, except microphytobenthic primary production. Finally,
	the problem of entrophication in Europe is discussed and the metabolic
	data obtained in the framework of the Land-Ocean Interactions in
	the Coastal Zone (LOICZ) project are compared with available direct
	measurements of net ecosystem production. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Gehlen1999,
	Abstract = {We present a numerical transport-reaction model that describes the
	interaction between oxic organic matter decay and CaCO3 dissolution
	in deep-sea sediments. The model simulates the distribution and isotopic
	composition of carbonate species (H2CO*(3), HCO3-, CO32-) in sediment
	porewaters. Forcing is provided by organic matter degradation by
	O-2, whereas calcium carbonate dissolution is included as a first
	order kinetic reaction with respect to porewater undersaturation.
	Modelling of the isotopic data strongly constrains rate estimates
	of TCO2 production by organic carbon mineralization and CaCO3 dissolution.
	Compared to previous models, this approach is independent of assumptions
	on reaction stoichiometry. The validity of the model is tested by
	simulating TCO2 delta(13)C and Ca2+ profiles for two sites, taken
	from Sayles and Curry (1988) located in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific
	(Omega(c) = 0.64) and Western North Atlantic (Omega(c), = 1.30).
	The model successfully reproduces observed porewater distributions
	of TCO2 delta(13)C, and Ca2+ Compared to estimates of TCO2 produced
	by organic matter respiration derived by Sayles and Curry (1988),
	model integrated rates of TCO2 production are larger by a factor
	of 1.6 at the Eastern Equatorial Pacific station and a factor of
	4.1 at the Western North Atlantic station. The model allows for a
	quantification of the alkalinity flux induced by metabolic CO2 released
	to porewaters during organic matter decay. CaCO3 dissolution driven
	by metabolic decay gives rise to a substantial alkalinity flux at
	the Western North Atlantic station and contributes up to 53% to total
	alkalinity exchange at the station from the Eastern Equatorial Pacific.
	Model-derived calcite dissolution rate constants are within a factor
	of 4 at the two sites. This low variability contrasts with previous
	studies, which reported dissolution rate constants differing by several
	orders of magnitude. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Modification of bovine adrenodoxin with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
	(EDC) dramatically inhibited the reaction with adrenodoxin reductase
	(EC 1.18.1.2). The modification did not cause any change in the visible
	spectrum of adrenodoxin, indicating that the iron-sulfur center was
	not perturbed. Furthermore, the anomalous fluorescence of Tyr 82
	was not changed in either intensity or wavelength. The inhibition
	was accompanied by the covalent incorporation of 14C-labeled EDC
	into adrenodoxin. The sites modified by EDC were determined by hydrolyzing
	adrenodoxin with either trypsin or Staphylococcus aureus protease
	and separating the resulting peptides by reverse phase high pressure
	liquid chromatography. The major carboxyl groups modified were found
	to be at Glu 74, Asp 79, and Asp 86, which are located in a sequence
	containing a high negative charge density. We propose that the conversion
	of negatively charged carboxylate groups at these residues to bulky,
	positively charged EDC-carboxyl groups inhibits the reaction with
	the reductase. EDC was also found to cross-link adrenodoxin to cytochrome
	c in yields up to 90%. The cross-links were found to involve the
	formation of amide linkages between carboxyl groups on adrenodoxin
	and the lysine amino groups surrounding the heme crevice of cytochrome

	cerebral cortex, 125I-Tyr0-oCRF was covalently incorporated into
	a protein of Mr = 58,000. Under identical conditions in the anterior
	pituitary of rat, monkey, cow, and pig, 125I-Tyr0-oCRF was incorporated
	into a protein of apparent Mr = 75,000. The specificity of the labeling
	was typical of the CRF binding site since both the cerebral cortex-
	and pituitary-labeled proteins exhibited the appropriate pharmacological
	rank order profile characteristic of the CRF receptor (Nle21,Tyr32-oCRF

	Abstract = {A description of the carbonate system has been incorporated in the
	MIRO biogeochemical model to investigate the contribution of diatom
	and Phaeocystis blooms to the seasonal dynamics of air-sea $CO_2$
	exchanges in the Eastern Channel and Southern Bight of the North
	Sea, with focus on the eutrophied Belgian coastal waters. For this
	application, the model was implemented in a simplified three-box
	representation of the hydrodynamics with the open ocean boundary
	box 'Western English Channel' (WCH) and the 'French Coastal Zone'
	(FCZ) and 'Belgian Coastal Zone' (BCZ) boxes receiving carbon and
	nutrients from the rivers Seine and Scheldt, respectively. Results
	were obtained by running the model for the 1996-1999 period. The
	simulated partial pressures of $CO_2$ (pCO(2)) were successfully
	compared with data recorded over the same period in the central BCZ
	at station 330 (51 degrees 26.05' N; 002 degrees 48.50' E). Budget
	calculations based on model simulations of carbon flow rates indicated
	for BCZ a low annual sink of atmospheric $CO_2$ (-0.17 mol C m(-2)
	y(-1)). On the opposite, surface water pCO(2) in WCH was estimated
	to be at annual equilibrium with respect to atmospheric $CO_2$. The
	relative contribution of biological, chemical and physical processes
	to the modelled seasonal variability of pCO(2) in BCZ was further
	explored by running model scenarios with separate closures of biological
	activities and/or river inputs of carbon. The suppression of biological
	processes reversed direction of the $CO_2$ flux in BCZ that became,
	on an annual scale, a significant source for atmospheric $CO_2$ (+0.53mol
	C m(-2) y(-1)). Overall biological activity had a stronger influence
	on the modelled seasonal cycle of pCO(2) than temperature. Especially
	Phaeocystis colonies which growth in spring were associated with
	an important sink of atmospheric $CO_2$ that counteracted the temperature-driven
	increase of pCO(2) at this period of the year. However, river inputs
	of organic and inorganic carbon were shown to increase the surface
	water pCO(2) and hence the emission of $CO_2$ to the atmosphere.
	Same calculations conducted in WCH, showed that temperature was the
	main factor controlling the seasonal pCO(2) cycle in these open ocean
	waters. The effect of interannual variations of fresh water discharge
	(and related nutrient and carbon inputs), temperature and wind speed
	was further explored by running scenarios with forcing typical of
	two contrasted years (1996 and 1999). Based on these simulations,
	the model predicts significant variations in the intensity and direction
	of the annual air-sea $CO_2$ flux.},

@article{Hellerstein1999,
	Abstract = {Mass isotopomer distribution analysis (MIDA) is a technique for measuring
	the synthesis of biological polymers. First developed approximately
	eight years ago, MIDA has been used for measuring the synthesis of
	lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins. The technique involves quantifying
	by mass spectrometry the relative abundances of molecular species
	of a polymer differing only in mass (mass isotopomers), after introduction
	of a stable isotope-labeled precursor. The mass isotopomer pattern,
	or distribution, is analyzed according to a combinatorial probability
	model by comparing measured abundances to theoretical distributions
	predicted from the binomial or multinomial expansion. For combinatorial
	probabilities to be applicable, a labeled precursor must therefore
	combine with itself in the form of two or more repeating subunits.
	MIDA allows dilution in the monomeric (precursor) and polymeric (product)
	pools to be determined. Kinetic parameters can then be calculated
	(e.g., replacement rate of the polymer, fractional contribution from
	the endogenous biosynthetic pathway, absolute rate of biosynthesis).
	Several issues remain unresolved, however. We consider here the impact
	of various deviations from the simple combinatorial probability model
	of biosynthesis and describe the analytic requirements for successful
	use of MIDA. A formal mathematical algorithm is presented for generating
	tables and equations (APPENDIX), on the basis of which effects of
	various confounding factors are simulated. These include variations
	in natural isotope abundances, isotopic disequilibrium in the precursor
	pool, more than one biosynthetic precursor pool, incorrect values
	for number of subunits present, and concurrent measurement of turnover
	from exogenously labeled polymers. We describe a strategy for testing
	whether isotopic inhomogeneity (e.g., an isotopic gradient or separate
	biosynthetic sites) is present in the precursor pool by comparing
	higher-mass (multiply labeled) to lower-mass (single- and double-labeled)
	isotopomer patterns. Also, an algebraic correction is presented for
	calculating fractional synthesis when an incomplete ion spectrum
	is monitored, and an approach for assessing the sensitivity of biosynthetic
	parameters to measurement error is described. The different calculation
	algorithms published for MIDA are compared; all share a common model,
	use overlapping solutions to computational problems, and generate
	identical results. Finally, we discuss the major practical issue
	for using MIDA at present: quantitative inaccuracy of instruments.
	The nature and causes of analytic inaccuracy, strategies for evaluating
	instrument performance, and guidelines for optimizing accuracy and
	reducing impact on biosynthetic parameters are suggested. Adherence
	to certain analytic guidelines, particularly attention to concentration
	effects on mass isotopomer ratios and maximizing enrichments in the
	isotopomers of interest, reduces error. Improving instrument accuracy
	for quantification of isotopomer ratios is perhaps the highest priority
	for this field. In conclusion, MIDA remains the "equation for biosynthesis,"
	but attention to potentially confounding factors and analytic performance
	is required for optimal application.},

	carbon isotope ratios of total dissolved inorganic carbon (delta(13)C(DIC))
	and suspended matter (delta(13)C(POC)) in the freshwater part of
	the River Scheldt. Two major sources of particulate organic matter
	(POM) occur in this riverine system: riverine phytoplankton and terrestrial
	detritus. In winter the lowest delta(13)C(DIC) values are observed
	due to enhanced input of $CO_2$ from decomposition of C-13-depleted
	terrestrial plant detritus (average delta(13)C(DIC) = -14.3 parts
	per thousand). During summer, when litter input from terrestrial
	flora is the lowest, water column respiration on POM of terrestrial
	origin is also the lowest as evidenced by less negative delta(13)C(DIC)
	values (average delta(13)C(DIC) = -9.9 parts per thousand). In winter
	the phytoplankton biomass is low, as indicated by low chlorophyll
	a concentrations (Chl a < 4.5 mu gl(-1)), compared to summer when
	chlorophyll a concentrations can rise to a maximum of 54 mu gl(-1).
	Furthermore, in winter the very narrow range of delta(13)C(POC) (from
	-26.5 to -27.6 parts per thousand) is associated with relatively
	high C/N ratios (C/N > 9) suggesting that in winter a major fraction
	of POC is derived from allochthonous matter. In summer delta(13)C(POC)
	exhibits a very wide range of values, with the most negative values
	coinciding with high Chl a concentrations and low C/N ratios (C/N
	< 8). This suggests predominance of phytoplankton carbon in the total
	particulate carbon pool, utilising a dissolved inorganic carbon reservoir,
	which is already significantly depleted in C-13. Using a simple two
	source mixing approach a reconstruction of the relative importance
	of phytoplankton to the total POC pool and of C-13/C-12 fractionation

	In spring and summer 1997 and 1998, large phytoplankton biomasses

	Abstract = {Processes affecting the concentration and isotopic composition of
	dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were investigated in pore waters
	of two freshwater intertidal areas of the Scheldt Estuary, Belgium.
	Pore water delta(13)C(DIC) values from marshes and mudflats varied
	from -27 to +13.4 parts per thousand, these very large variations
	reflect the contribution of different carbon sources to the DIC pool.
	
	In pore waters of the upper mudflat, river water DIC and dissolution
	of calcite contribute to a lesser extent (10% and 16% respectively)
	to the total DIC pool. Results indicate that inorganic carbon added
	to the pore water of the mudflats has a delta(13)C value of +20.3
	parts per thousand in May 1998. These strongly enriched delta(13)C(DIC)
	values suggest that the major contribution (up to three-quarters)
	to total DIC is $CO_2$ derived from methanogenesis.
	
	In pore waters of the marshes, $CO_2$ derived from organic matter
	degradation (-27.5 parts per thousand) and river DIC (-11.5 to -16.1
	parts per thousand) are the major sources of inorganic carbon contribution
	to the total DIC pool. In pore waters from a marsh site colonised
	by willow trees, the contribution from $CO_2$ derived from organic
	matter degradation is larger than in pore waters from an area with
	only reed vegetation. In the latter case river water DIC is the major
	source of pore water DIC.},

	Abstract = {Mixed layer seawater samples from t`he Southern Ocean were analyzed
	for the triple oxygen isotope composition (delta(17)O and delta(18)O)
	of dissolved O-2 and the ratio of [O-2] to [Ar]. delta(17)O and delta(18)O
	together constrain the mass independent anomaly in O-2, and hence
	the fraction of photosynthetic O-2 in the dissolved O-2 pool. Assuming
	oxygen in the mixed layer is at steady state, we calculate ratios
	of the gross photosynthetic O-2 production rate to the O-2 air-sea
	gas exchange rate, and ratios of net to gross O-2 production rates.
	With estimates of the O-2 gas exchange rate from a wind speed parameterization,
	we determine absolute in situ rates of gross and net O-2 production.
	Based on the net/gross production ratios and delta(18)O of dissolved
	O-2, we calculate a value for the O-18 fractionation factor associated
	with marine respiration in the Southern Ocean mixed layer of 0.978
	(an isotope effect of 22parts per thousand). The study regions cover
	latitudes between similar to45degreesS and the ice edge at: (1) 175degreesE
	in December 1999, (2) 145degreesE in December 2000, and (3) 145degreesE
	in January 2001. At both meridians, gross O-2 production decreases
	to the south. At 145degreesE, rates of net O-2 production follow
	the same pattern, while at 175degreesE these rates are consistently
	low at all latitudes. In December, gross and net O-2 production rates
	are both higher at 145degreesE than at 175degreesE. Gross O-2 production
	at 145degreesE was similar in December and January, but net O-2 production
	decreased by similar to50%. Net/gross C production ratios, calculated
	by scaling O-2 production rates, are lower than estimates of the
	N-15 f-ratio, determined as the ratio of (NO3)-N-15 uptake to (NO3-)-N-15
	+ (NH4+)-N-15 uptake in N-15 incubations. They are also lower than
	ef-ratios predicted by the model of Laws et al. (Global Biogeochem.
	Cycles 14 (2000a) 1231) at the temperatures of the Southern Ocean.
	The differences in the measurements could be due to natural interannual
	and spatial variability or the differences in metabolic rates measured
	and modeled, and the fundamental assumptions required by each technique.

	Abstract = {FlexX-Pharm, an extended version of the flexible docking tool FlexX,
	allows the incorporation of information about important characteristics
	of protein-ligand binding modes into a docking calculation. This
	information is introduced as a simple set of constraints derived
	from receptor-based type pharmacophore features.
	
	The constraints are determined by selected FlexX interactions and
	inclusion volumes in the receptor active site. They guide the docking
	process to produce a set of docking solutions with particular properties.
	By applying a series of look-ahead checks during the flexible construction
	of ligand fragments within the active site, FlexX-Pharm determines
	which partially built docking solutions can potentially obey the
	constraints. Solutions that will not obey the constraints are deleted
	as early as possible, often decreasing the calculation time and enabling
	new docking solutions to emerge. FlexX-Pharm was evaluated on various
	individual protein-ligand complexes where the top docking solutions
	generated by FlexX had high root mean square deviations (RMSD) from
	the experimentally observed binding modes. FlexX-Pharm showed an
	improvement in the RMSD of the top solutions in most cases, along
	with a reduction in run time. We also tested FlexX-Pharm as a database
	screening tool on a small dataset of molecules for three target proteins.
	In two cases, FlexX-Pharm missed one or two of the active molecules
	due to the constraints selected. However, in general FlexX-Pharm
	maintained or improved the enrichment shown with FlexX, while completing
	the screen in considerably less run time.},

	Abstract = {The bifunctional reagents para-phenyldimaleimide and maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide
	ester were used to chemically cross-link the subunits of the transducin
	and cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) complexes of bovine rod photoreceptor
	cells. The cross-linked products were identified by Western immunoblotting
	using antisera against purified subunits of transducin (T alpha and
	T beta gamma) and PDE. Oligomeric cross-linked products of transducin
	subunits as large as (T alpha beta gamma)3 were observed in the latent
	form of transducin with bound GDP. In addition to the expected T
	alpha beta and T beta gamma cross-linked products, a (T alpha gamma)2
	structure was detected. The close proximity of T alpha and T gamma
	suggests that T gamma may play a role in conferring the specificity
	of the interaction between T alpha and rhodopsin. Most of the oligomeric
	cross-linked structures between T alpha and T beta gamma were diminished
	in the activated form of transducin, with guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imidotriphosphate)
	(Gpp(NH)p) bound. However, cross-linking between T beta and T gamma
	was not altered. These results suggest that transducin exists as
	an oligomer in solution which dissociates upon the binding of Gpp(NH)p.
	To identify the possible interacting domains between the T alpha,
	T beta, and T gamma subunits, the cross-linked products were subjected
	to limited tryptic proteolysis. Several cross-linked tryptic peptides
	of transducin subunits were found and include the cross-linked products
	of the N terminus 15-kDa fragment of T beta and the C terminus 5-kDa
	fragment of T alpha, T gamma and the 12-kDa fragment of T alpha,
	T gamma and the 15-kDa as well as the 23-kDa fragments of T beta,
	and an intra-T alpha cross-linked product of the 2- and 21-kDa fragments.
	These results have allowed the construction of a topographical model
	for the transducin subunits. The organization of the subunits of
	PDE (P alpha, P beta, and P gamma) was also studied. The formation
	of the high molecular size cross-linked products of PDE resulted
	in the concurrent loss of the P beta and P gamma subunits, suggesting
	that they are in close proximity. Finally, the interaction between
	transducin and PDE was examined by chemical cross-linking of transducin-Gpp(NH)p
	and PDE. Two additional cross-linked products of 180 and 210 kDa
	were obtained which could be due to the cross-linking of T alpha
	or T beta with P alpha beta subunits.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	the method of variance stabilizing transformations. For large intensities,
	h coincides with the logarithmic transformation, and Deltah with
	the log-ratio. The parameters of h together with those of the calibration

@article{Huynen2000,
	Abstract = {Various new methods have been proposed to predict functional interactions
	between proteins based on the genomic context of their genes. The
	types of genomic context that they use are Type I: the fusion of
	genes; Type II: the conservation of gene-order or co-occurrence of
	genes in potential operons; and Type III: the co-occurrence of genes
	across genomes (phylogenetic profiles). Here we compare these types
	for their coverage, their correlations with various types of functional
	interaction, and their overlap with homology-based function assignment.
	We apply the methods to Mycoplasma genitalium, the standard benchmarking
	genome in computational and experimental genomics. Quantitatively,
	conservation of gene order is the technique with the highest coverage,
	applying to 37% of the genes. By combining gene order conservation
	with gene fusion (6%), the co-occurrence of genes in operons in absence
	of gene order conservation (8%), and the co-occurrence of genes across
	genomes (11%), significant context information can be obtained for
	50% of the genes (the categories overlap). Qualitatively, we observe
	that the functional interactions between genes are stronger as the
	requirements for physical neighborhood on the genome are more stringent,
	while the fraction of potential false positives decreases. Moreover,
	only in cases in which gene order is conserved in a substantial fraction
	of the genomes, in this case six out of twenty-five, does a single
	type of functional interaction (physical interaction) clearly dominate
	(>80%). In other cases, complementary function information from homology
	searches, which is available for most of the genes with significant
	genomic context, is essential to predict the type of interaction.
	Using a combination of genomic context and homology searches, new
	functional features can be predicted for 10% of M. genitalium genes.},

	Abstract = {Patterns of longitudinal and temporal variation in rates of primary
	production, respiration and nitrification were investigated in the
	Urdaibai estuary during August 1994. Rates of primary production,
	as measured with the C-14 technique, varied between 0.002 and 2.828
	mg C l(-1) d(-1). C-14 and oxygen based rates of primary production
	showed a good correlation, but photosynthetic quotients (mean PQ
	of 2.2) were higher than expected from considerations of the N source
	used by the algae. Chlorophyll a biomass showed an inverse correlation
	with salinity and tidal flushing is hypothesized to be a major controlling
	factor of its spatial variability. Temporal variations in chlorophyll
	a concentration were associated primarily to changes in the lunar
	cycle and following rain events. Rates of community respiration varied
	between 0.154 and 6.857 mg O-2 l(-1) d(-1) and were significantly
	and positively correlated with both bacterial abundance and chlorophyll
	a concentration. The relationship between respiration and primary
	production suggested that respiration rates based on substrates not
	associated with the autochthonous pelagic primary production increased
	greatly from the outer to the inner estuary and that the consumption
	of autotrophic production by heterotrophs in the water column was
	higher in the less productive outer estuary than in highly productive
	intermediate and inner areas. Except at the innermost station, temporal
	variations in respiration rates followed variations in temperature.
	The ratio of gross primary production to respiration (GP/R) showed
	marked spatial and temporal variations, ranging from 0.24 to 17.94.
	Rates of nitrification, measured as allylthiourea sensitive rates
	of $CO_2$ fixation, varied from undetectable levels to 9.3 mu g C
	l(-1) d(-1). In general, highest rates of nitrification were observed
	at the inner estuary under conditions of elevated ammonia concentration,
	high bacterial abundance and high turbidity. Rates of nitrification

	propionate) and disuccinimidyl tartrate. Cross-linked proteins were
	resolved by one- and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
	gel electrophoresis. Individual subunits were detected by silver
	staining or by Western blotting and staining with subunit-specific
	antisera. Products larger than 80,000 daltons were not analyzed.
	Interactions between F1 subunits included cross-links between gamma

	Abstract = {Despite its status of master variable, there have been relatively
	few attempts to quantitatively predict the distributions of pH in
	biogeochemical reactive transport systems. Here, we propose a theoretical
	approach for calculating the vertical pore water profiles of pH and
	the rates of proton production and consumption in aquatic sediments.
	In this approach, the stoichiometric coefficients of species that
	participate in acid-base equilibrium reactions are treated as unknown
	variables in the biogeochemical reaction network. The mixed kinetic-equilibrium
	reaction system results in a set of coupled differential and algebraic
	equations and is solved using a new numerical solver. The diagnostic
	capabilities of the model are illustrated for depositional conditions
	representative of those encountered on the continental shelf. The
	early diagenetic reaction network includes the major microbial degradation
	pathways of organic matter and associated secondary redox reactions,
	mineral precipitation and dissolution processes, and homogeneous
	acid-base reactions. The resulting pH profile in this baseline simulation
	exhibits a sharp decrease below the sediment-water interface, followed
	by an increase with depth mid again a decrease. The features of the
	pH profile are explained in terms of the production and consumption
	of protons by the various biogeochemical processes. Secondary oxygenation
	reactions are the principal proton producers within the oxic zone,
	while reduction of iron mid manganese oxyhydroxides are primarily
	responsible for the reversal in the pH gradient in the. suboxic zone.
	Proton production in the zone of sulfate reduction outweighs alkalinity
	production, maintaining the undersaturation of the pore waters with
	respect to calcite. Integrated over the entire depth of early diagenesis,
	dissolution of CaCO3 is the main sink for protons. Variations in
	the reaction rate order and rate constant for CaCO3 dissolution do
	not fundamentally alter the shape of the pH profile. An entirely
	different shape is obtained, however, when the pore waters are assumed
	to remain in thermodynamic equilibrium with calcite at all depths.
	Pore water (bio)irrigation decreases the amplitude of pH changes
	in the sediment and may modify the shape of the pH profile.},

	structures, in comparative structural analysis, in the design and
	engineering of novel functional sites, and in the prediction of structure
	and function of uncharacterised proteins.},

	of this method is that it does not rely on detection of conserved

	graph (SN-graph), which is constructed from the chains of similarity
	and neighborhood relationships between orthologous genes in different
	genomes and adjacent genes in the same genome, respectively. An SN-cycle
	is defined as a closed path on the SN-graph and is postulated to
	preferentially join functionally related gene products that participate
	in the same biochemical or regulatory process. We demonstrate the
	substantial non-randomness and functional significance of SN-cycles
	derived from real genome data and estimate the prediction accuracy
	of SNAP in assigning broad function to uncharacterized proteins.

	uptake ratios from the Redfield ratio have been reported. A comprehensive
	data set including all carbon and nitrogen pools relevant to biological
	production in the surface ocean (DIC, DIN, DOG, DON, POC, PON) was
	used to calculate seasonal new production based on carbon and nitrogen
	uptake hi summer along 20 degreesW in the northeast Atlantic Ocean.
	The 20 degreesW transect between 30 and 60 degreesN covers different
	trophic states and seasonal stages of the productive surface layer,
	including early bloom, bloom, post-bloom and non-bloom situations.
	The spatial pattern has elements of a seasonal progression. We also
	calculated exported production, i.e., that part of seasonal new production
	not accumulated in particulate and dissolved pools, again separately
	for carbon and nitrogen. The pairs of estimates of 'seasonal new
	production' and 'exported production' allowed us to calculate the
	C : N ratios of these quantities. While suspended particulate matter
	in the mixed layer largely conforms to Redfield stoichiometry, marked
	deviations were observed in carbon and nitrogen uptake and export
	with progressing season or nutrient depletion. The spring system
	was characterized by nitrogen overconsumption and the oligotrophic

	of seasonal new as well as exported production increase from early
	bloom values of 5-6 to values of 10-16 in the post-bloom/oligotrophic

	analysis of the relationship with wind speed and tidal stage. Exchange
	coefficients ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 g O(2)(.)m(-2) h(-1) atm(-1)
	(equivalent to piston velocities of 1.5 to 7 cm h(-1)) for wind speeds
	of 0.3 to 9 m s(-1) at 10 m elevation. While the relationships for
	each estuary appear linear (significant linear regressions with wind
	speed were shown for each estuary, and the slopes were different
	at the 99.5% confidence level), the range of speeds differed at the
	two sites and an exponential function of wind speed was consistent
	with the combined data from both estuaries. A power function of wind
	speed was not an acceptable model. The exchange coefficients for
	our estuaries are from 57% to as low as 9% of that predicted by previously
	published generic equations. Because the atmospheric correction can
	be significant in shallow, metabolically active coastal waters, we
	suggest that empirically determined relationships for gas exchange
	versus wind for a specific estuary are preferable to the predictions
	of the general equations. While the floating chamber method should
	be used cautiously, at low winds speeds (below 8 to s(-1)) and in
	slowly flowing waters, it provides a convenient approach for quantifying
	these site-specific differences. The differences, especially those

	(RIS) in Wadden Sea sediment as well as sulfur gas emissions directly
	to the atmosphere were measured at intervals of 2 to 12 months from
	1991 to 1994. Three stations were chosen in the intertidal embayment,
	Konigshafen, representing the: range of sediments found in the Wadden
	Sea: Organic-poor coarse sand, organic-poor and Arenicola marina
	inhabited medium sand, and organic-rich muddy sand. Maximum SRRt
	were 2 to 5 times higher in muddy sand than in the sandy sediments.
	The depth-integrated SRRt varied 12 to 13-fold on a seasonal basis
	at the three stations. Although temperature controls biochemical
	processes, the overall control is more complex due to the simultaneous
	influence of other seasonal factors such as availability of organic
	matter and oxidation level of surface sediment. The sedimentary RIS
	pools were low due to iron limitation and contained only 30% acid
	volatile sulfur (AVS). Muddy sand had up to an order of magnitude
	more RIS than the two sandy sediments. The turnover of RIS was rapid
	(turnover time from similar to 1 to 32 h), fastest during summer
	and at the sandy stations. The emission of S-gases was dominated
	by H2S during summer (45-67% of the total), and was highest in muddy

	(3-49% of the total). Other sulfur gases, such as COS, DMS and CS2,
	each accounted for less than 20% of the total sulfur emissions with

	of metals in the sediment, the reduced sulfur pools are cycled rapidly

	Abstract = {Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to the problems of statistical
	modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein
	families and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the
	globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand
	calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an HMM are
	estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the HMM
	is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training
	sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22 database for
	other sequences that are members of the given protein family, or
	contain the given domain. The HMM produces multiple alignments of
	good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs
	that incorporate three-dimensional structural information. When employed
	in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in
	a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able
	to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a
	high degree of accuracy. Both the HMM and PROFILESEARCH (a technique
	used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply
	aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than PROSITE (a
	dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appears to
	have a slight advantage over PROFILESEARCH in terms of lower rates
	of false negatives and false positives, even though the HMM is trained
	using only unaligned sequences, whereas PROFILESEARCH requires aligned

	The SPM concentrations varied between 32 and 447 mg m(-3), with two

	five cruises in the winter of 1999/2000. Taking into account vertical/lateral
	exchange processes and the decomposition of organic matter, the monthly
	changes in CT were used to determine $CO_2$ evasion fluxes. In addition,
	the $CO_2$ fluxes were calculated on the basis of the $CO_2$ partial
	pressure differences using local wind speed (u) records and different
	currently applied parametrizations of the gas exchange transfer velocity
	(k). The latter resulted in substantially lower monthly fluxes that

	Abstract = {The Snowball Earth theory initially proposed by Kirschvink (1992)
	to explain the Neoproterozoic glacial episodes, suggested that the
	Earth was fully ice-covered at 720 Ma (Sturtian episode) and 640
	Ma (Marinoan episode). This succession of extreme climatic crises
	induced environmental perturbations which are considered as a strong
	selective pressure on the evolution of life (Hoffman et al., 1998).
	Using a numerical model of carbon-alkalinity global cycles, we quantify
	environmental stresses caused by a global glaciation. According to
	our results, we suggest that during global glaciations, the ocean
	becomes acidic (pH similar to 6), and undersaturated with respect
	to carbonate minerals. Moreover the quick transition from ice-house
	to greenhouse conditions implies an abrupt and large shift of the
	oceanic surface temperature which causes an extended hypoxia. The
	intense continental weathering, in the aftermath of the glaciation,
	deeply affects the seawater composition inducing rapid changes in
	terms of pH and alkalinity. We also propose a new timing for post
	glacial perturbations and for the cap carbonates deposition, similar
	to 2 Myr instead of 200 kyr as suggested in a previous modelling
	study. In terms of Precambrian life sustainability, seawater pH modifications
	appear drastic all along the glaciation, but we suggest that the
	buffering action of the oceanic crust dissolution avoids a total
	collapse of biological productivity. But short-lived and large post-glacial
	perturbations are more critical and may have played the role of an
	environmental filter proposed in the classic snowball Earth theory.
	Although the link between environmental changes and life sustainability
	cannot be modelled accurately, we suggest that only a permissive
	life (Knoll, 2003) may explain the relative continuity in microfossils
	diversity observed before, during and after Neoproterozoic glaciation
	events.},

	Abstract = {The stable isotope composition (delta(15)N and delta(18)O) of nitrate
	was measured during Summer 1999 in the anaerobic hypolimnion of eutrophic
	Lake Lugano (Switzerland). Denitrification was demonstrated by a
	progressive nitrate depletion coupled to increasing delta(15)N and
	delta(18)O values for residual nitrate. Maximum delta(15)N and delta(18)O
	values amounted to 27.2 and 15.7parts per thousand, respectively.
	N-15 and O-18 enrichment factors for denitrification (8) were estimated
	using a closed-system model and a dynamic diffusion-reaction model.
	Using the Rayleigh equation (closed-system approach), we obtained
	epsilon values of -11.2 and -6.6parts per thousand for nitrogen and
	oxygen, respectively. The average e values derived using the diffusion-reaction
	model were determined to be -20.7 +/- 3.8 for nitrogen and -11.0
	+/- 1.7 for oxygen. Both N and O isotope fractionation appeared to
	be lower, when denitrification rates where high, possibly in association
	with high organic carbon availability. In addition, variations in
	the isotope effects may be attributed to the variable importance
	of sedimentary denitrification having only a small isotope effect
	on the water column. The combined measurement of N and O isotope
	ratios in nitrate revealed that coupled nitrification-denitrification
	in the open-wafer was of minor importance. This is the first study
	of nitrogen and oxygen isotope effects associated with microbial
	denitrification in a natural lake. Moreover, this study confirms
	the high potential of delta(18)O of nitrate as a valuable biogeochemical
	tracer in aquatic systems, complementing nitrate delta(15)N. Copyright

	Estimates of denittification rate from benthic flux stoichiometry
	range from 0.9 to 2.5 mmol N m(-2) d(-1). Between 46% and 100% of

@article{Lemmen1998,
	Abstract = {If no structural information about a particular target protein is
	available, methods of rational drug design try to superimpose putative
	ligands with a given reference, e.g., an endogenous ligand. The goal
	of such structural alignments is, on the one hand, to approximate
	the binding geometry and, on the other hand, to provide a relative
	ranking of the ligands with respect to their similarity. An accurate
	superposition is the prerequisite of subsequent exploitation of ligand
	data by either 3D QSAR analyses, pharmacophore hypotheses, or receptor
	modeling. We present the automatic method FLEXS for structurally
	superimposing pairs of ligands, approximating their putative binding
	site geometry. One of the ligands is treated as flexible, while the
	other one, used as a reference, is kept rigid. FLEXS is an incremental
	construction procedure. The molecules to be superimposed are partitioned
	into fragments. Starting with placements of a selected anchor fragment,
	computed by two alternative approaches, the remaining fragments are
	added iteratively. At each step, flexibility is considered by allowing
	the respective added fragment to adopt a discrete set of conformations.
	The mean computing time per test case is about 1:30 min on a common-day
	workstation. FLEXS is fast enough to be used as a tool for virtual
	ligand screening. A database of typical drug molecules has been screened
	for potential fibrinogen receptor antagonists. FLEXS is capable of
	retrieving all ligands assigned to platelet aggregation properties
	among the first 20 hits. Furthermore, the program suggests additional
	interesting candidates, likely to be active at the same receptor.
	FLEXS proves to be superior to commonly used retrieval techniques
	based on 2D fingerprint similarities. The accuracy of computed superpositions
	determines the relevance of subsequently performed ligand analyses.
	In order to validate the quality of FLEXS alignments, we attempted
	to reproduce a set of 284 mutual superpositions derived from experimental
	data on 76 protein-ligand complexes of 14 proteins. The ligands considered
	cover the whole range of drug-size molecules from 18 to 158 atoms
	(PDB codes: 3ptb, 2er7). The performance of the algorithm critically
	depends on the sizes of the molecules to be superimposed. The limitations
	are clearly demonstrated with large peptidic inhibitors in the HIV
	and the endothiapepsin data set. Problems also occur in the presence
	of multiple binding modes (e.g., elastase and human rhinovirus).
	The most convincing results are achieved with small- and medium-sized
	molecules (as, e.g., the ligands of trypsin, thrombin, and dihydrofolate
	reductase). In more than half of the entire test set, we achieve
	rms deviations between computed and observed alignment of below 1.5
	A. This underlines the reliability of FLEXS-generated alignments.},

	are reformulated to give equations for pK(1) and pK(2) (pK = - log(10)K)
	as a function of seawater temperature and salinity, consistent with
	the ''total hydrogen ion'' concentration scale:

	Abstract = {Three "easy-to-use solvers are presented for the approximation of
	pH acid the concentrations of protolytic species in marine aqueous
	systems. The first one is based on the conservation of alkalinity,
	the second one describes the progress (advancement) of a chemical
	reaction towards its state of equilibrium. and the third one is based
	on the conservation of the charges in the system (charge balance).
	They are developed for steady state or nun-steady state modelling,
	but they are also useful for pH calculations from measured data sets.
	To demonstrate their numerical stability over a wide range of pH,
	the solvers are tested with random input values. Internal consistency
	is checked by mass and charge conservation and by comparing the results
	of each solver. In closed systems, equilibrium calculations lead
	to identical pH values and species concentrations, as expected. The
	three approaches are also tested in a non-steady-state transport-reaction
	model that simulates early diagenesis in oxic deep-sea sediments
	as well as in reactive sediments from the deep Arabian Sea. In the
	model, dissolved carbonate species are either transported as individual
	species ($CO_2$, HCO3-, CO32-) or as summed variables (TCO2, alkalinity).
	In the first case, the species are transported according to their
	individual molecular diffusion coefficients and concentration gradients.
	In the second case, protolytic species are transported along the
	gradient of summed concentrations using weighted overage diffusion
	coefficients. The advancement approach is coupled with transport
	of the individual species, whereas the alkalinity conservation and
	the charge balance approaches are applied to transport of summed
	variables. The model results show that the approaches lead to non-negligible
	differences in the species distribution and the pH. With intensive
	calcium carbonate dissolution, the thermodynamically-controlled dissolution
	rates dominate the system: in this case, the differences in the species
	distribution between the three solvers and the two transport schemes

	Abstract = {Recently, a new method has been introduced for the estimation of photosynthetic
	oxygen production from the triple isotope composition (delta(17)O
	and delta(18)O) of dissolved O-2 in the ocean and of air O-2 in ice
	cores. This method is based on the deviations ((17)Delta) from mass
	dependent respiratory fractionation, the major process affecting
	the isotopic composition of air O-2. To apply this method, the slope
	in the O-17/O-16 VS. O-18/O-16 relationship used for (17)Delta calculation
	must be known with high accuracy. Using numerical simulations and
	closed system experiments, we show how the respiratory slope is manifested
	in the (17)Delta of O-2 in situations where respiration is the only
	process affecting oxygen isotopic composition (kinetic slope), and
	in systems in steady state between photosynthesis and respiration
	(steady state slope). The slopes of the fractionation line in these
	two cases are different, and the reasons of this phenomenon are discussed.
	To determine the kinetic respiratory slope for the dominant O-2 consumers
	in aquatic systems, we have conducted new experiments using a wide
	range of organisms and conditions and obtained one universal value
	(0.5179 +/- 0.0006) in ln(delta(17)O + 1) vs. ln(delta(18)O + 1)
	plots. It was also shown that the respiratory fractionations under
	light and dark are identical within experimental error. We discuss
	various marine situations and conclude that the kinetic slope 0.518
	should be used for calculating (17)Delta of dissolved O-2. In contrast,
	a steady state fractionation slope should be used in global mass
	balance calculations of triple isotope ratios of O-2 in air records

@article{Luz1999,
	Abstract = {Oxygen has three naturally occurring isotopes, of mass numbers 16,
	17 and 18, Their ratio in atmospheric O-2 depends primarily on the
	isotopic composition of photosynthetically produced O-2 from terrestrial
	and aquatic plants(1-3), and on isotopic fractionation due to respiration(4).
	These processes fractionate isotopes in a mass-dependent way, such
	that O-17 enrichment would be approximately half of the O-18 enrichment
	relative to O-16. But some photochemical reactions in the stratosphere
	give rise to a mass-independent isotope fractionation, producing
	approximately equal O-17 and O-18 enrichments in stratospheric ozone(5)
	and carbon dioxide(6,7), and consequently driving an atmospheric
	O-2 isotope anomaly. Here we present an experimentally based estimate
	of the size of the O-17/O-16 anomaly in tropospheric O-2, and argue
	that it largely reflects the influences of biospheric cycling and
	stratospheric photochemical processes. We propose that because the
	biosphere removes the isotopically anomalous stratosphere-derived
	O-2 by respiration, and replaces it with isotopically 'normal' oxygen
	by photosynthesis, the magnitude of the tropospheric O-17 anomaly
	can be used as a tracer of global biosphere production. We use measurements
	of the triple-isotope composition of O-2 trapped in bubbles in polar
	ice to estimate global biosphere productivity at various times over
	the past 82,000 years. In a second application, we use the isotopic
	signature of oxygen dissolved in aquatic systems to estimate gross
	primary production on broad time and space scales.},

	Abstract = {Rivers and estuaries transport organic carbon (C) from terrestrial
	and freshwater ecosystems to the marine environment. During this
	transit, bacteria actively utilize and transform organic C, but few
	studies have measured detailed spatial variation in rates of bacterial
	respiration (BR) and production (BP). We measured BP at 39 stations
	and BR at 12 stations at monthly intervals along a 200-km reach of
	the tidal Hudson River. We observed strong repeatable spatial patterns
	for both BP and BR, with rates declining in the downstream direction.
	Bacterial Production had much greater dynamic range of spatial variation
	than BR. We used the detailed seasonal and spatial data on BP and
	BR to measure the total C demand of bacteria at several scales. We
	calculated volumetric and areal rates for 12 sections of the Hudson,
	as well as the total C utilization. Volumetric BR averaged 20 g-C-m(-3)
	y(-1), but it was highest in the most upstream section at 30 g C
	m(-3) y(-1). Areal rates averaged over the entire river were 174
	g C m(-2) y(-1), but they were 318 g C m(-2) y(-1) in the deepest
	section of the river, indicating the importance of morphometric variation.
	Total bacterial C demand increased downriver with increasing total
	volume. Overall, bacteria in the freshwater section of the river
	consumed approximately 18-25.5 x 10(-9) g C y(-1), about 20% of the
	total organic C load.},

@article{Marinelli1996,
	Abstract = {Macrofaunal irrigation is an important process in nearshore sediments,
	facilitating greater exchange between sediments and seawater and
	imparting significant lateral heterogeneity to the porewater profiles
	of many constituents. Like many macrofaunal activities, irrigation
	is a transient behavior, i.e. tubes and burrows are flushed periodically,
	at frequencies that generally are species-specific. As a result,
	transient concentrations within the dwelling arise, potentially impacting
	gradients, fluxes and reaction rates in the vicinity of the dwelling.
	We investigated the impact of periodic burrow irrigation on the distribution
	of several diagenetically important porewater constituents. Laboratory
	experiments evaluated irrigation periodicity using artificially irrigated
	tubes embedded in nearshore organic-rich sediments, and microdistributions
	of oxygen and pH in laboratory experiments were measured with microelectrodes.
	To help interpret our results, we also constructed a simplified time
	and space-dependent transport-reaction model for oxygen, pH and sulfide
	in irrigated sediments.
	
	Laboratory results show substantial differences in the pH field of
	sediments surrounding an irrigated tube as a function of irrigation
	frequency. Higher pH values, indicative of an overlying water signature,
	were observed in the vicinity of the tube wall with increasing duration
	of irrigation. Conversely, oxygen concentrations did not vary significantly
	with the amount of irrigation, most likely a result of extremely
	high sediment oxygen demand. Model results are consistent with laboratory
	findings in predicting differences in the measured variables as a
	function of irrigation frequency. However, the nature and extent
	of the model-predicted differences are often at variance with the
	experimental data. Overall, experimental and modeling results both
	suggest irrigation periodicity can substantially influence porewater
	distributions and diagenetic processes in sediments. Future studies
	should examine the influence of irrigation periodicity on the types
	and rates of reactions, and the attendant biological features, in
	the environment encompassing the tube or burrow wall.},

	Abstract = {Direct covariance air-sea $CO_2$ flux measurements over the open ocean
	are reported. These measurements were performed during June 1998
	in the North Atlantic within a significant $CO_2$ sink. These direct
	estimates are in general agreement with the traditional geochemical
	isotope constraints. The covariance, or eddy correlation, technique
	directly measures the air-sea $CO_2$ flux over hour timescales by
	correlating the fluctuations of $CO_2$ with the turbulent vertical
	velocity fluctuations in the atmospheric surface layer. These measurements
	quantify the transfer of $CO_2$ between the atmosphere and ocean
	over a range of wind speeds and improve the understanding of the
	environmental factors controlling the flux. The relatively large
	flux of $CO_2$ in the study region, together with improved analytical
	techniques, facilitated the measurements. The half-hour mean wind
	speeds varied from 0.9 to 16.3 m s(-1) over the month-long experiment.
	The mean pCO(2) during the study period was -85.8 +/- 16.0 mu atm,
	and the mean covariance $CO_2$ flux was estimated at 4.6 mol m(-2)
	yr(1). The average observed wind speed was 7.7 m s(-1). This is in
	close agreement with 3.9 mol m(-2) yr(-1), the approximate $CO_2$
	flux based on C-14 parameterizations at this wind speed. At high
	winds, where the relationship between gas physical properties, surface
	processes, and air-sea gas exchange is still elusive, direct $CO_2$
	flux measurements are crucial. The measurements for winds in excess
	of 11 m s(-1) show a general enhancement of gas transfer velocity
	over previous indirect measurements, and it is believed that this
	enhancement can be explained by the fact that the indirect methods
	cannot discriminate surface process variability such as atmospheric
	stability, upper ocean mixing, wave age, wave breaking, or surface
	films.},

	Abstract = {Functional links between proteins can often be inferred from genomic
	associations between the genes that encode them: groups of genes

	objects (elements, species, parameters, reactions). A detailed review
	is given of the transport and reaction components available for model
	construction. Upon assemblage, the model is channelled to the numerical
	subunit of the MEDIA package. Via a canonical transformation, the
	user-defined mixed kinetic-equilibrium model is rearranged into a
	proper set of differential algebraic equations (DAE), for which both
	steady state and transient solutions can be calculated. Steady-state
	profiles are obtained either directly using a Newton-Raphson method,
	or alternatively, as the asymptotic result of a dynamic simulation.
	Dynamic simulations involve a global implicit procedure based on
	the stiff-ODE solver package VODE, employing a direct substitution
	approach to reduce the number of equations in the DAE system. Verification
	of the MEDIA code was accomplished (1) by comparison with analytic
	models and (2) by emulating the model formulation and output of the
	existing diagenetic model code STEADYSED. As an example application.
	a diagenetic model was constructed to analyse an extensive dataset
	collected from a marine sediment in the Santa Barbara Basin (California).
	The different pathways of organic matter mineralization were modelled,
	and the coupling among the biogeochemical cycles of C, O, N, S, Mn
	and Fe was investigated. Depth profiles of both porewater and solid-phase
	constituents could be reproduced with great accuracy. (C) 2003 Elsevier

	Abstract = {Analysis of three recent diagenetic model codes (OMEXDIA, CANDI and
	STEADYSED) revealed that codes have a rigid, static and problem-specific
	character, leaving little autonomy for the application user. The
	resulting lack of flexibility and extensibility, and the associated
	need for ground-level reprogramming, constitutes a major barrier
	for potential model users. Present codes have apparently passed a
	critical threshold of code complexity, above which code development
	becomes time-consuming and expensive using the present procedure-oriented
	techniques. We have explored the advantages of object-oriented technology
	and the concept of a problem-solving environment to improve the quality
	of software for reactive transport modelling. A general blueprint
	for an object-oriented code for modelling early diagenesis is presented.
	The MEDIA environment consists of a toolbox of building blocks (element,
	species and process objects), which can be combined freely by the
	user to construct new models (without the need for recompilation).
	An object-oriented database stores current objects and accommodates
	new user-defined building blocks. Altogether, it is advocated that
	by improving the software quality, one can substantially lower the
	threshold for using model codes as an integrated data-analysis tool.

	rates of mineralization. Spatial differences in mineralization were
	mainly due to differences in the lability of the organic matter,
	since the quantity of organic matter was similar between stations
	on an areal or volume basis. Average first-order decomposition rate
	constants ranged from 0.2 to 7 yr(-1) and decreased towards the seaward

	in nine tidal estuaries in Europe (Elbe, Ems, Thames, Rhine, Scheldt,
	Loire, Gironde, Douro and Sado). The Rhine, Scheldt and Gironde estuaries
	have been studied seasonally. A number of different methodologies
	have been used and they yielded consistent results. Surface water
	concentrations ranged from 0.002 to 3.6 muM, corresponding to saturation
	ratios of 0.7 to 1580 with a median of 25. Methane concentrations
	in the fresh-water end-members varied from 0.01 to 1.4 muM. Methane
	concentrations in the marine end-members were close to saturation
	offshore and on the order of 0.1 muM in estuarine plumes. Methane
	versus salinity profiles in river-dominated, stratified estuaries
	(Rhine and Douro) appeared rather erratic whereas those in the well
	mixed, long-residence time estuaries (Elbe, Ems, Thames, Scheldt,
	Loire, Gironde and Sado) revealed consistent trends. In these systems
	dissolved methane initially decreases with increasing salinity, then
	increases to a maximum at intermediate to high salinities before
	decreasing again going offshore. Tidal flats and creeks were identified
	as a methane source to estuarine waters. The global estuarine flux
	of methane to the atmosphere has been calculated by combining the
	median water-air methane gradient (68.2 nmol dm(-3)) with a global
	area weighted transfer coefficient and the global area of estuaries.

	well as those obtained during the GEOSECS and TTO studies. The salinity
	normalized alkalinity (NTA = TA X 35/S) in subtropical gyres between
	30 degrees S and 30 degrees N is remarkably invariable except in
	upwelling areas (e.g., the Eastern Equatorial Pacific). The NTA increases
	toward high latitudes (> 30 degrees) and is inversely proportional
	to sea surface temperature (SST). This increase in NTA with latitude
	(or decreasing temperature) is attributed to the upward transport
	of deep waters with higher NTA due to the dissolution of CaCO3(s).
	The distribution of surface NTA in the major ocean basins shows that
	the major basins can be divided into regions where different trends
	of NTA are observed and boundaries between the regions are similar
	to those of the major ocean currents. The linear behavior of NTA
	(similar to +/- 5 mu mol kg-L) with respect to SST makes it possible
	to provide regional maps of NTA. These maps can be used to estimate
	TA in surface waters in large areas of the ocean from values of SST
	and salinity (S). By combining the estimates of TA using SST and
	S (from the Climatological Atlas of the World Ocean) with underway
	f(CO2) measurements (by ships, moorings, and satellites), it is possible
	to map the detailed distribution of TCO2 for surface waters over
	a large area of the ocean. Calculations of TCO2 from measurements
	of f(CO2), SST, and S in the subtropical Pacific Ocean agree with
	the coulometrically measured values to +/- 5 mu mol kg(-1). (C) 1998

	(Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, Sr2+, Cl-, SO42--, HCO3-, Br-, CO32-, B(OH)(4)(-),
	B(OH)(3) and $CO_2$) of seawater and the ion pairing model is used
	to account for the strong interaction of Fe(II) and Fe(III) with
	major and minor ligands (Cl-, SO42-, OH-, HCO3-, and HS-) in the
	waters. The model can be used to estimate the activity and speciation
	of iron in natural waters as a function of composition (major sea
	salts) and ionic strength (0 to 3 M). The measured stability constants
	(K-FeX*) of Fe(II) and Fe(III) have been used to estimate the thermodynamic
	constants (K-FeX) and the activity coefficient of iron complexes
	(gamma(FeX)) with a number of inorganic ligands in NaClO4 medium
	at various ionic strengths:
	
	ln(K-FeX*/gamma(Fe)gamma(X)) = ln K-FeX - ln(gamma(FeX))
	
	The activity coefficients for free ions (gamma(Fe), gamma(X)) needed
	for this extrapolation have been estimated from the Fitter equations.
	The activity coefficients of the ion pairs have been used to determine
	Pitzer parameters (B-FeX, B-FeX(0), C-FeX(phi)) for the iron complexes.
	These results make it possible to estimate the stability constants
	for the formation of Fe(II) and Fe(III) complexes over a wide range

	Abstract = {Present-day production of CaCO3 in the world ocean is calculated to

	in sediments; the other 40 % is dissolved. Nearly half of the carbonate
	sediment accumulates on reefs, banks, and tropical shelves, and consists
	largely of metastable aragonite and magnesian calcite. Deep-sea carbonates,
	predominantly calcitic coccoliths and planktonic foraminifera, have
	orders of magnitude lower productivity and accumulation rates than
	shallow-water carbonates, but they cover orders of magnitude larger
	basin area. Twice as much calcium is removed from the oceans by present-day
	carbonate accumulation as is estimated to be brought in by rivers
	and hydrothermal activity (1.6 bt), suggesting that outputs have
	been overestimated or inputs underestimated, that one or more other
	inputs have not been identified, and/or that the oceans are not presently
	in steady state. One ''missing'' calcium source might be groundwater,
	although its present-day input is probably much smaller than that
	of rivers. If, as seems likely, CaCO3 accumulation presently exceeds
	terrestial and hydrothermal input, this imbalance presumably is offset
	by decreased accumulation and increased input during lowered sea
	level: shallow-water accumulation decreases by an order of magnitude
	with a 100 m drop in sea level, while groundwater influx increases

	Abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are applied as a new type of model
	to estimate the daily pH of the Middle Loire river. The model is
	used for pH measurement screening, error detection (abnormal values,
	discontinuities and recording drifts) and validating the collected
	data. The measured values of pH are compared with the values estimated
	by the ANN model using statistical tests to verify homogeneity and
	stationarity. River water pH is affected by numerous processes: biological,
	physical and geochemical. Examples are: CO2 pressure equilibrium
	with the atmosphere, photosynthesis, respiration of plants, organic
	matter degradation, geological and mineral background, pollution
	etc. Inter-relationships between these processes and pH values are
	complex, non-linear and not well understood. As a neural network
	provides a non-linear function mapping of a set of input variables
	into the corresponding network output, without the requirement of
	having to specify the actual mathematical form of the relation between
	the input and output variables, it has the versatility for modelling
	a wide range of complex non-linear phenomena. For this reason the
	neural network approach has been selected and tested for pH modelling.
	We used the classical multilayer perceptron model (MLP).
	
	River discharge and solar radiation variables are used as inputs to
	the MLP model. The choice of these variables is dictated by what
	are perceived to be the predominant processes that control pH in
	the Middle Loire river, which is typically eutrophic during the low-flow
	summer period. The influence of the previous day's flows and radiation
	has been evaluated in the calibration and verification test. The
	best network found to simulate pH was one with two input nodes and
	three hidden nodes. The inputs are: daily discharge and a variable
	called 'Index of anterior radiation', i.e. calculated as an exponential
	smoothing of the daily radiation variable. When calibrated over 4
	years of data and tested (i.e. verified) for a one-year independent
	set of data, the model proved satisfactory on pH simulations, with
	accuracies in the order of 86%. After elaborating the pH model, the
	Student test and the cumulative Page-Hinkley test were applied for
	automatic detection of changes in the mean of the residuals from
	the ANN pH model. This analysis has shown that such tests are capable
	of detecting a measurement error occurring over a short period of
	time (1-4 days). (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	of the models, by comparing the resolution in time and space, and
	the resolution of the trophic structure by discussing the number

	The review of biogeochemical/ecological modelling for the greater

	Abstract = {The structure of the salinity field in northern San Francisco Bay
	and how it is affected by freshwater flow are discussed. Two datasets
	are examined: the first is 23 years of daily salinity data taken
	by the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation along the axis of northern San
	Francisco Bay; the second is a set of salinity transects taken by
	the U. S. Geological Survey between 1988 and 1993. Central to this
	paper is a measure of salinity intrusion, X-2 : the distance from
	the Golden Gate Bridge to where the bottom salinity is 2 psu. Using
	X-2 to scale distance, the authors find that for most flow conditions,
	the mean salinity distribution of the estuary is nearly self-similar
	with a salinity gradient in the center 70% of the region between
	the Golden Gate and X-2 that is proportional to X-2(-1). Analysis
	of covariability of Q and X-2 showed a characteristic timescale of
	adjustment of the salinity field of approximately 2 weeks. The steady-state
	response deduced from the X-2 time series implies that X-2 is proportional
	to riverflow to the 1/7 power. This relation, which differs from
	the standard 1/3 power dependence that is derived theoretically assuming
	constant exchange coefficients, shows that the upstream salt flux
	associated with gravitational circulation is more sensitive to the
	longitudinal salinity gradient than theory supposes. This is attributed
	to the strengthening of stratification caused by the stronger longitudinal
	salinity gradient that accompanies larger river flows.},

	Abstract = {The source of whitings on the Great Bahama Bank and their relationship
	to major changes in the chemistry of Bank waters have been among
	the longest and most hotly debated topics in carbonate geochemistry.
	In this paper, we demonstrate that the reaction kinetics of calcite
	with Bank waters for a given saturation state are similar to, but
	somewhat slower (2 to 3 times) than with Gulf Stream water. The interpretation
	of the reaction kinetics of suspended Bank sediment with Bank water
	requires that the precipitating phase be about twice as soluble as
	aragonite. Good agreement at equivalent saturation states was found
	between experimental precipitation rates and those calculated for
	the rate of change of Bank water chemistry in the region of whitings.
	These results indicate that the dominant mode of carbonate removal
	is via precipitation on resuspended sediments rather than the rapid
	pseudo-homogeneous precipitation of calcium carbonate in the water
	column resulting in the formation of a whiting. Estimates indicate
	that single aragonite needles may be resuspended many times over
	a period of decades during which they experience repeated overgrowth.
	A major portion (>98%) of suspended calcium carbonate is outside
	the visually dramatic whitings. Thus, as visually spectacular as
	they are, whitings do not represent a short-term locally massive
	precipitation of carbonate on the Great Bahama Bank, nor are they
	even likely to be the dominant sites of carbonate removal in this
	region. Although future refinements are needed that include seafloor
	processes, we have at this point arrived at a mechanistic kinetic
	model that provides a reasonably quantitative explanation for the
	hydrochemistry of the carbonate system on the northern Great Bahama

	Abstract = {The N-15/N-14 of nitrate in the external medium and intracellular

	Fryxell et Hasle was measured during nitrate assimilation under low
	light, a 12:12-h light:dark cycle, low temperature, or low iron conditions.
	The N-15/N-14 of the nitrate in the medium and the particulate matter
	both followed the predicted Rayleigh fractionation model, and the
	intracellular nitrate always had a higher N-15/N-14 than did the
	medium nitrate. When the experiments were compared, the results showed
	a negative correlation between the isotope fractionation factor and
	the difference in the N-15/N-14 between the two pools of nitrate.
	These observations imply that the variations in the isotope effect
	result from variations in the degree to which the fractionation by
	nitrate reductase is expressed outside the cell, which is, in turn,
	controlled by the rate of nitrate efflux relative to nitrate reduction.
	The low iron and low temperature experiments showed relatively small
	isotope effects but a large intracellular-medium difference in nitrate
	N-15/N-14, consistent with a relative rate of efflux (compared with
	influx) that is small and similar to fast-growing cells. In contrast,
	large isotope effects and small intracellular-medium differences
	in nitrate N-15/N-14 were observed for low light and light:dark cycle
	grown cells and are explained by higher relative rates of nitrate
	efflux under these growth conditions.},

	Given an aligned set of protein sequences, EMOTIF generates a set

	also can generate motifs that describe possible subfamilies of a
	protein superfamily. A disjunction of such motifs often can represent

	than 50,000 motifs. For each alignment, the database contains several
	motifs having a probability of matching a false positive that range
	from 10(-10) to 10(-5). Highly specific motifs are well suited for
	searching entire proteomes, while generating very few false predictions.
	IDENTIFY assigns biological functions to 25-30% of all proteins encoded

	tracer experiments in the southern North Sea during February 1992
	and 1993. A conservative tracer, spores of the bacterium Bacillus
	globigii var. Niger, was used for the first time in an in situ air-sea
	gas exchange experiment. This nonvolatile tracer is used to correct
	for dispersive dilution of the volatile tracers and allows three
	estimations of the transfer velocity for the same time period. The
	first estimation of the power dependence of gas transfer on molecular
	diffusivity in the marine environment is reported. This allows the
	impact of bubbles on estimates of the transfer velocity derived from
	changes in the helium/sulphur hexafluoride ratio to be assessed.
	Data from earlier dual tracer experiments are reinterpreted, and
	findings suggest that results from all dual tracer experiments are
	mutually consistent. The complete data set is used to test published
	parameterizations of gas transfer with wind speed. A gas exchange
	relationship that shows a dependence on wind speed intermediate between
	those of Liss and Merlivat [1986] and Wanninkhof [1992] is found
	to be optimal. The dual tracer data are shown to be reasonably consistent
	with global estimates of gas exchange based on the uptake of natural

	Abstract = {In 1987 the National Institute for Coastal and Marine Management (the
	Netherlands) initiated the SAWES project (Systems Analysis WEstern
	Scheldt). The main goals of the project were to acquire knowledge
	with respect to the pollution problems in the Scheldt estuary and
	to apply this knowledge to management issues of the Scheldt on an
	operational level. The main interest was to understand quantitatively
	the relation between inputs of polluting substances and effects on
	the ecosystem. In the framework of the project, a water quality model
	for the Scheldt estuary was made. In 1995, the model area was expanded
	to include the Belgian coastal region at the mouth of the estuary.
	
	The model calculates the fate of discharged substances and establishes
	the relation between pollution inputs and the resulting water quality,
	including general water quality (oxygen, pH, alkalinity, major ion
	chemistry and nutrients) as well as pollutant concentrations. The
	model incorporates all chemical processes which affect these concentrations,
	including the precipitation/dissolution of metal sulphides which
	to a large extent controls the fate of trace metals. Based on calibration
	and verification exercises, it has been shown that the model provides
	a good representation of the physical and chemical processes taking
	place within the estuary and can therefore be used to support policy
	development for the estuary. For example, the model can compute how
	the water and sediment quality in the estuary will respond to reduced
	inputs of waste or to such human activities as dredging.},

	20-5 mu M, epsilon was -24.6 +/- 5.5, -27.2 +/- 1.6, and -7.8 +/-
	3.0 parts per thousand. In these cultures, isotopic fractionation
	by phytoplankton caused variations in delta(15)N of up to 50 parts
	per thousand for NH4+, 12 parts per thousand for NO3-, and 25 parts
	per thousand for particulate N. Similar variability in the delta(15)N
	Of both dissolved inorganic and particulate organic N pools should
	be expected during phytoplankton blooms in nature. As a result, phytoplankton-mediated
	isotopic variability must be considered when isotopic data are used
	to examine biogeochemical and physical processing of organic matter
	in marine ecosystems, particularly when biosynthesis and loss processes
	are decoupled in either space or time during bloom conditions.},

	Abstract = {Eutrophication due to high anthropogenic nutrient loading has greatly
	impacted ecological processes in marine coastal waters and, therefore,
	much effort has been put into reducing nitrogen and phosphorus discharges
	into European and North-American waters. Nutrient enrichment usually
	resulted in increase of biomass and production of phytoplankton and
	microphytobenthos, often coinciding with shifts in species composition
	within the primary producer community. Consequences of increasing
	eutrophication for higher trophic levels are still being disputed,
	and even less is known about the consequences of nutrient reduction
	on coastal food webs. Here, we present 30-year concurrent field observations
	on phytoplankton, macrozoobenthos and estuarine birds in the Dutch
	Wadden Sea, which has been subject to decades of nutrient enrichment
	and subsequent nutrient reduction. We demonstrate that long-term
	variations in limiting nutrients (phosphate and silicon) were weakly
	correlated with biomass and more strongly with community structures
	of phytoplankton, macrozoobenthos and estuarine birds. Although we
	cannot conclusively determine if, and if so to what extent, nutrient
	enrichment and subsequent nutrient reduction actually contributed
	to the concurrent trends in these communities, it appears likely
	that part of the variance in the studied coastal communities is related
	to changes in nutrient loads. Our results imply that nutrient reduction
	measures should not ignore the potential consequences for policies
	aimed at bird conservation and exploitation of marine living resources.},

	Abstract = {Using information from sequence alignments significantly improves
	protein secondary structure prediction. Typically, more divergent
	profiles yield better predictions. Recently, various groups have
	shown that accuracy can be improved significantly by using PSI-BLAST
	profiles to develop new prediction methods. Here, we focused on the
	influences of various alignment strategies on two 8-year-old PHD
	methods. The following results stood out. (i) PHD using pairwise
	alignments predicts about 72% of all residues correctly in one of
	the three states: helix, strand, and other. Using larger databases
	and PSI-BLAST raised accuracy to 75%. (ii) More than 60% of the improvement
	originated from the growth of current sequence databases; about 20%
	resulted from detailed changes in the alignment procedure (substitution
	matrix, thresholds, and gap penalties). Another 20% of the improvement
	resulted from carefully using iterated PSI-BLAST searches. (iii)
	It is of interest that we failed to improve prediction accuracy further
	when attempting to refine the alignment by dynamic programming (MaxHom
	and ClustalW). (iv) Improvement through family growth appears to
	saturate at some point. However, most families have not reached this
	saturation. Hence, we anticipate that prediction accuracy will continue

	Abstract = {The concentration and O-18:O-16 ratio of dissolved oxygen were measured
	for 23 rivers and lakes of the Amazon Basin during 1988, 1990, and
	1991. With only two exceptions, the rivers and lakes had dissolved
	oxygen concentrations that were at 20-90% of atmospheric saturation
	levels. The delta(18)O of the dissolved oxygen ranged from 15 to
	30% (vs. SMOW). The delta(18)O for the lakes were the lowest at 15-23%.
	delta(18)O < 24.2 parts per thousand (the atmospheric equilibrium
	value) are the result of photosynthetic oxygen input. The delta(18)O
	of the rivers, in contrast, ranged from 24 to 30 parts per thousand.
	delta(18)O > 24.2 parts per thousand resulted from respiration. Despite
	this clear difference between the delta(18)O for rivers and lakes,
	these water bodies had similar levels of oxygen undersaturation.
	The delta(18)O and dissolved oxygen concentrations are used to determine
	the ratio of community respiration (R) to gross photosynthesis (P)
	rates. R: P varied between similar to 1 and 1.5 for lakes and between
	1.5 and 4 for rivers. For all rivers and lakes, the measured delta(18)O
	indicated the presence of photosynthetically produced oxygen, with
	the highest proportion occurring in lakes. The delta(18)O of dissolved

	Keywords = {TN TP Time series Nutrient reconstruction Western Wadden Sea In this paper we reconstruct the Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP) inputs into the western Wadden Sea from its major freshwater source the lake IJsselmeer between 1935-1998. The reconstruction is based on the TN and TP loads of the river Rhine at the German/Dutch border and follows the aquatic continuum approach to calculate loads further downstream in (1) the river IJssel feeding the IJsselmeer, and (2) the discharge of this lake into the western Wadden Sea. Our objectives are to determine (1) how the signal of changing nutrient loads of the Rhine is transferred downstream, and (2) how hydrological changes in the rivers-and-lake system affected the TN and TP discharges into the western Wadden Sea. Observational data from which TN and TP loads of the river Rhine could be calculated date back to the 1960s and we used background loads for European rivers for the period before World War II. The period in between was interpolated using the historic scenarios of watershed land use and management tested for the hypothetical Phison river (Billen and Garnier, 1997, Aquat. Microb. Ecol. 13, 3-17), adapted for the hydrology of the Rhine. The interpolations were constrained by loads of dissolved inorganic N and P compounds, for which data go back to the 1930s. Using the reconstructed loads of the river Rhine, TN and TP loads of the river IJssel and the lake IJsselmeer were calculated with simple mass balance models that were calibrated against data available from 1972-1993 onwards. Results show a gradual 12-fold increase of the TN discharge of the IJsselmeer into the Wadden Sea from 1935 to 1988, after which it decreased to levels still ~5 fold those in 1935. The discharge of TP increased more abruptly in the early 1960s to values in 1983 ~10 fold those before 1965, followed by a sharp decrease to values still ~2.5 fold those before 1965. These patterns resemble those in the river Rhine, but are modified due to (1) variability of other sources to the lake, and (2) reduction of the retention capacity of the lake due to enormous land reclamation. TN:TP atomic ratios in the freshwater input to the Wadden Sea as high as 100 in 1995 were caused by successful P reduction programmes, less successful N reduction and N-rich inputs from smaller rivers and land runoff into the lake IJsselmeer. Land reclamation caused the lake's retention of TN to decrease step-wise from ~70% to ~45-50% and that of TP from 85% to 55-60% between 1950 and 1980.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Matching of chemical interacting groups is a common concept
	for docking and fragment placement algorithms in computer-aided drug
	design. These algorithms have been proven to be reliable and fast
	if at least a certain number of hydrogen bonds or salt bridges occur.
	However, the algorithms typically run into problems if hydrophobic
	fragments or ligands should be placed. In order to dock hydrophobic
	fragments without significant loss of computational efficiency, we
	have extended the interaction model and placement algorithms in our
	docking tool FlexX. The concept of multi-level interactions is introduced
	into the algorithms for automatic selection and placement of base
	fragments. RESULTS: With the multi-level interaction model and the
	corresponding algorithmic extensions, we were able to improve the
	overall performance of FlexX significantly. We tested the approach
	with a set of 200 protein-ligand complexes taken from the Brookhaven
	Protein Data Bank (PDB). The number of test cases which can be docked
	within 1.5 A RMSD from the crystal structure can be increased from
	58 to 64%. The performance gain is paid for by an increase in computation

	Abstract = {A possible way of tackling the molecular docking problem arising in
	computer-aided drug design is the use of the incremental construction
	method. This method consists of three steps: the selection of a part
	of a molecule, a so-called base fragment, the placement of the base
	fragment into the active site of a protein, and the subsequent reconstruction
	of the complete drug molecule. Assuming that a part of a drug molecule
	is known, which is specific enough to be a good base fragment, the
	method is proven to be successful for a large set of docking examples.
	In addition, it leads to the fastest algorithms for flexible docking
	published so far. In most real-world applications of docking, large
	sets of ligands have to be tested for affinity to a given protein.
	Thus, manual selection of a base fragment is not practical. On the
	other hand, the selection of a base fragment is critical in that
	only few selections lead to a low-energy structure. We overcome this
	limitation by selecting a representative set of base fragments instead
	of a single one. In this paper, we present a set of rules and algorithms
	to automate this selection. In addition, we extend the incremental
	construction method to deal with multiple fragmentations of the drug
	molecule. Our results show that with multiple automated base selection,
	the quality of the docking predictions is almost as good as with
	one manually preselected base fragment. In addition, the set of solutions
	is more diverse and alternative binding modes with low scores are
	found. Although the run time of the overall algorithm increases,
	the method remains fast enough to search through large ligand data
	sets.},

	Abstract = {We present an automatic method for docking organic ligands into protein
	binding sites. The method can be used in the design process of specific
	protein ligands. It combines an appropriate model of the physico-chemical
	properties of the docked molecules with efficient methods for sampling
	the conformational space of the ligand. If the ligand is flexible,
	it can adopt a large variety of different conformations. Each such
	minimum in conformational space presents a potential candidate for
	the conformation of the ligand in the complexed state. Our docking
	method samples the conformation space of the ligand on the basis
	of a discrete model and uses a tree-search technique for placing
	the ligand incrementally into the active site. For placing the first
	fragment of the ligand into the protein, we use hashing techniques
	adapted from computer vision. The incremental construction algorithm
	is based on a greedy strategy combined with efficient methods for
	overlap detection and for the search of new interactions. We present
	results on 19 complexes of which the binding geometry has been crystallographically
	determined. All considered ligands are docked in at most three minutes

	Abstract = {A coupled, fully transient, multicomponent reaction-transport model
	has been developed to estimate long-term fluxes of reactive compounds
	in strong tidal estuaries. The model is applied to a preliminary
	analysis of the carbon cycle in the Scheldt estuary in Belgium and
	The Netherlands. The model provides a realistic description of the
	residual circulation in a strong tidal estuary and includes the essential
	feedback mechanisms between interdependent chemical species. The
	model has been used to analyze the fundamentally transient nature
	of strong tidal estuaries and, in particular, the effect of these
	non-steady state conditions on the long-term fluxes of chemical species
	out of the estuary. The results indicate that flux estimation techniques
	based upon steady-state assumptions may result in significant errors.
	The model has also been used to investigate biogeochemical interactions
	characterized by a large spectrum of time scales, which it does by
	including simultaneous equilibrium reactions and kinetically-mediated
	processes. Simulations carried out with the model suggest that a
	formulation based upon microbially-mediated, kinetically-controlled
	reactions provides a superior description of solute profiles in the
	Scheldt estuary than does a global equilibrium redox formulation.
	The mixed equilibrium-kinetic formulation also makes it possible
	to track simultaneously two master variables: the redox state of
	the system and the pH. By providing strong constraints on the system,
	these two master Variables can be used to test the model's self-consistency.
	The simulations carried out with the model suggest the pH profile
	in the Scheldt estuary is the result of a balance of biogeochemical
	reactions which produce H+ and degassing which consumes H+ and not
	the result of simple mixing between seawater and freshwater. (C)

	Abstract = {Nitrous acid (HONO) and the nitrite ion represent a particularly important
	conjugate pair of trace species with regard to heterogeneous behavior
	within the bulk, and on the surface, of aqueous atmospheric dispersions:
	this role results from their chemical reactivity, photolysis pathways,
	solubility, and ambient concentration levels. The actual ratio of
	NO2-: HONO in solution is determined by the pH and the nitrous acid
	dissociation constant (pK(a)) which is generally quoted in the literature
	as 3.27 at 298 K. However there is much disagreement in published
	works as to the exact value, which should be used in model calculations
	relevant to the atmosphere. Furthermore even though the nitrite ion
	is known to absorb solar radiation in the 300-400 nm region and represents
	a dominant source of .OH radicals in surface seawater, large variations
	in the measured molar decadic absorption coefficients, epsilon, for
	nitrite ions (and aqueous HONO) are evident in the literature. In
	the current study, using a UV-vis spectrometric approach with careful
	baseline subtraction, the relevant c values for the nitrite ion were
	determined to be 8.16 +/- 0.08 M-1 cm(-1) for the npi* transitions
	at 290 nm and 22.1 +/- 0.22 M-1 cm-1 at 354 run. For HONO, the wavelength
	maximum for the strongest vibronic band in solution was found at
	372 nm with an E value of 60.52 +/- 0.6 M-1 cm(-1). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch
	equation and the above data, a value of 2.8 +/- 0.1 is therefore
	reported here for the pKa of nitrous acid. A Newton-Gauss method
	was then employed to solve a set of nonlinear equations defining
	the chemical speciation model for HONO in solution using an algorithm
	written in FORTRAN 90. A model based on a simple one-step protonation
	worked well for intermediate pHs (6-3) but departed from the experimental
	observations in highly acidic media. A two-step equilibrium model
	involving the nitroacidium ion, H2ONO+, gave a much closer fit in
	the very acidic region, while having little or no effect on the pH
	6-3 section of the profile.},

	to a known volume of seawater with rapid spectrophotometric measurement
	of pH (3 to 4) and calculation of the TA after stripping out the
	CO2. The flowing total alkalinity system (FLTA) consists of a calibrated
	volumetric pipette (similar to 100 cm(3)), a thermostated mixing
	cell (similar to 200 cm(3)), a computerized piston titrator, a platinum
	thermometer, and a Hewlett Packard diode array spectrophotometer
	with a flowing spectrophotometric cell as the detector. All the electronic
	components have interfaces which are easily connected to a personal
	computer and manipulated using a Quick Basic program. The FLTA system
	makes continuous measurements of TA from the shipboard flowing seawater
	line. Laboratory results (N = 127) on Gulf Stream seawater (GSSW)
	have shown a precision within +/-2-3 mu mol kg(-1) in TA. Certified
	reference materials (CRMs) measured at sea (N = 14) gave precise

	the surface waters of the oceans which would not be visible when

	family information in this form increases the prediction accuracy
	by six to eight percentage points. A combination of three levels
	of networks results in an overall three-state accuracy of 70.8% for
	globular proteins (sustained performance). If four membrane protein
	chains are included in the evaluation, the overall accuracy drops

	The accuracy in predicting the content of three secondary structure
	types is comparable to that of circular dichroism spectroscopy. The

	70degreesS to 65degreesN (excluding the South China Sea, the Yellow
	Sea, the Japan/East Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk) was 44.5 +/- 5 Pg
	C in 1994. Approximately 28 Pg C was located in the Southern Hemisphere
	and 16.5 Pg C was located north of the equator. The deepest penetration
	of anthropogenic $CO_2$ is found at about 50 S. The shallowest penetration
	is found just north of the equator. Very shallow anthropogenic $CO_2$
	penetration is also generally observed in the high-latitude Southern
	Ocean. One exception to this is found in the far southwestern Pacific
	where there is evidence of anthropogenic $CO_2$ in the northward
	moving bottom waters. In the North Pacific a strong zonal gradient

	changes in concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) and chlorophyll
	a (Chl a). The lowest (17)Delta anomaly (excess 110) was found during
	October and the highest in August. There was a prominent subsurface

	The gross oxygen production (GOP) computed on the basis of triple

	oxygen incubation method. This could possibly be because of inability
	to measure O-2 uptake rates in the light bottle and the consequent

	source of CO2 to the atmosphere of 0.7 mol C m(-2) yr(-1) that represents
	7 to 27% of the inner Scheldt estuary CO2 emission. Results also
	highlight that a high spatial and temporal coverage of the surface

	in the surface waters of the Baltic Proper was used to estimate the
	net biomass production during recent years and at the beginning of
	the last century. Current pCO(2) data were available from 17 cruises
	in the eastern Gotland Sea during 1995-2001, and provided the mean
	seasonal pCO(2) cycle. Taking into account temperature and salinity,
	the pCO(2) seasonality was used to calculate the changes in the total
	$CO_2$ (C-N(T), normalized to total alkalinity) on the basis of the
	equilibrium relationships of the marine $CO_2$ system. A carbon balance
	was established for the productive period taking into account the
	C-N(T) depletion, the $CO_2$ air/sea exchange and the formation of
	dissolved organic carbon. The closing term of the balance was attributed
	to the integral net production of particulate organic carbon, P-POC,
	that was considered to represent the biomass production. The maximum
	P-POC was 3.6 +/- 0.3 mol m(-2) and indicated the termination of
	net production by the end of July. Historic pCO(2) data were available
	from measurements of alkalinity and pH performed during the spring

	yielded a P-POC of 1.4 mol m(-2) with an error range of +/-0.4 mol
	m(-2) that was mainly attributed to the uncertainty in the pH measurements.
	This indicates an increase in the net biomass productivity of the

	Abstract = {A tentative nitrogen budget for the Westerschelde (SW Netherlands)
	is constructed by means of a simulation model with thirteen spatial
	compartments. Biochemical and chemical processes in the water column
	are dynamically modeled; fluxes of dissolved constituents across
	the water-bottom interface are expressed by means of diagenetic equations.
	
	The model is calibrated on a large amount of observed variables in
	the estuary (1980-1986) with relatively fine temporal and spatial
	detail. Additional constraints are imposed by the stoichiometric
	coupling of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen flows and the required conservation
	of mass. The model is able to reproduce rather well the observed
	distributions of nitrate, ammonium, oxygen and Kjeldahl nitrogen
	both in time and space. Also, model output of biochemical oxygen
	demand and total organic carbon falls within observed ranges.
	
	By far the most pervasive process in the nitrogen cycle of the estuary
	is nitrification which mainly takes place in the water column of
	the upper estuarine part. On average about three times as much nitrate
	is leaving the estuary at the sea side compared to what enters from
	the river and from waste discharges. Ammonium on the other hand is
	consumed much faster (nitrification) than it is regenerated and only
	about one third of the total import leaves the estuary at the sea
	side. The budget for detrital nitrogen reveals import from the river,
	from wastes and from the sea. Phytoplankton uptake of inorganic nitrogen
	is negligible in the model.
	
	About 21% of total nitrogen, 33% of inorganic nitrogen, is removed
	from the estuary (mainly to the atmosphere through denitrification)
	and the load of nitrogen net exported to the sea amounts to about
	51000 tonnes per year. Total denitrification in our model is lower
	than what was estimated in the literature from the late seventies,
	where a nitrogen removal up to 40-50% of the total inorganic load
	was reported. Part of the differences could be methodological, but
	inspection of the nutrient profiles that led to these conclusions
	show them to be different to the ones used in our study. The oxygen
	deficient zone has moved upstream since the late seventies, entrailing
	the zone of denitrification into the riverine part of the Schelde.
	The nitrification process now starts immediately upon entering the

	Abstract = {The autotrophic production and heterotrophic consumption of organic
	matter in the Westerschelde, a highly turbid and eutrophic estuary
	in the Southwest Netherlands is examined by means of a dynamic simulation
	model. The model describes the ecologically relevant processes in
	thirteen spatial compartments and adequately fits most observed data.
	
	Three autotrophic processes are included in the model. Net pelagic
	photosynthetic production is relatively low (average 41. gC m(-2)
	yr(-1)) and three spatial compartments near the turbidity maximum
	zone are respiratory sinks of phytoplankton biomass. According to
	the model, net phytobenthic primary production is more important
	than pelagic primary production in the upstream half of the Westerschelde.
	On the scale of the entire estuary, benthic primary production amounts
	to about 60% of pelagic primary production. Water-column nitrification,
	which is very important in the nitrogen cycle, is most pronounced
	near the turbidity zone where it accounts for the major autotrophic
	fixation of carbon (up to 27 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Viewed on the scale
	of the total estuary, however, the process is not very important.
	
	Less than 20% of total organic carbon input to the estuary is primary
	produced, the remainder is imported from waste discharges and from
	the river.
	
	The degree of heterotrophy of the Westerschelde estuary proved to
	be one of the highest yet reported. On average 380 g carbon per square
	metre is net lost per year (range 200-1200 gC m(-2) yr(-1)). The
	yearly community respiration (bacterial mineralization, respiration
	of higher trophic levels and sedimentation) is 4 to 35 times (estuarine
	mean of 6) higher than the net production. This degree of heterotrophy
	is highest near the turbidity maximum and generally decreases from
	the freshwater to the seaward boundary. About 75% of all carbon losses
	can be ascribed to pelagic heterotrophic processes; the sediment
	is only locally important.
	
	Mineralisation rates are highest in the turbidity region, but as only
	a fraction of total carbon resides here, less than 20% of all organic
	carbon is lost in this part of the estuary. This result is in contradiction
	with a previous budget of the estuary, based on data of the early
	seventies, where more than 80% of all carbon was estimated to be
	lost in the turbidity zone. Part of this discrepancy is probably
	caused by changes that have occurred in the estuary since that time.
	
	Due to the high heterotrophic activity, nearly all imported and in
	situ produced carbon is lost in the estuary itself and the Westerschelde
	is an insignificant source of organic matter to the coastal zone.
	
	The model estuary acts as a trap for reactive organic matter, both
	from the land, from the sea or in situ produced. Internal cycling,
	mainly in the water column, results in the removal of most of the
	carbon while the more refractory part is exported to the sea.},

	t of zooplankton dry weight (DW) is imported from the sea to the

	within the zooplankton community relative to that in the sea. Possible

	Abstract = {Net phytoplankton productivity in the Westerschelde, a relatively
	deep, highly turbid and eutrophic estuary in the Southwest Netherlands,
	was examined by means of a 13-compartment dynamic simulation model.
	The description of the light-limited primary production was based
	on the model of Eilers and Peeters (1988, Ecol. Model., 42, 185-198).
	This light limitation was parameterized to the different model compartments
	by integrating the Eilers-Peeters model over a day and over depth,
	taking into account the morphology of the Westerschelde compartments,
	the daily fluctuating light regime and characteristics of the photosynthesis-light
	curves of the phytoplankton community. The availability of light
	to the phytoplankters limited primary production to on average similar
	to 2% of maximal production. Basin morphology, the turbidity gradient
	and light emission were important in the light-limitation function.
	Nutrient limitation was almost non-existent, except for diatoms in
	the marine part in summer, where production decreased to similar
	to 85% due to silicate limitation. A large fraction of algal biomass
	was respired by the algae in the model. From late fall to early spring,
	the entire estuary was a respiratory sink for modeled phytoplankton
	biomass. Viewed on a yearly scale, phytoplankton respiration exceeded
	gross production in three model compartments where turbidity and
	basin morphology were most limiting. Due to the high turbidity of
	the area and the relatively large mixing depth, net pelagic primary
	production in the model was relatively low: the global estuarine
	average was 41 g C m(-2) year(-1). It fluctuated from a negative
	production of -74 g C m(-2) year(-1) in the turbidity zone to a maximum
	net production of 60 g C m(-2) year(-1) near the sea. Salinity stress
	mortality was the main factor causing freshwater algal stocks to
	decline, while marine and brackish phytoplankton biomass was mainly
	controlled by grazing.},

	Abstract = {We present a numerical model of sedimentary early diagenetic processes
	that includes oxic and anoxic mineralization. The model belongs to
	the new wave of early diagenesis models that account for depth-dependent
	bioturbation and porosity profiles; it can be used both for calculating
	steady-state conditions and transient simulation. It was developed
	to reproduce the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen along the
	ocean margin; it resolves the sediment-depth profiles of carbon,
	oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, and other reduced substances.
	
	Organic carbon is modeled as two degradable fractions with different
	first-order degradation rates and nitrogen:carbon ratios, to account
	for the decreasing reactivity and N/C ratio of the organic matter
	with depth into the sediment. The consumption of oxygen and nitrate
	as terminal electron accepters is explicitly modeled, and mineralization
	is limited both by carbon (first order kinetics) and by oxidant availability
	(Michaelis-Menten type kinetics). Nitrification and oxic mineralization
	are decoupled, which allows the description of ammonium profiles.
	Mineralization processes using other oxidants (manganese oxides,
	iron oxides, sulphate) are lumped into one process, where degradation
	is only carbon limited; the terminal electron accepters are not explicitly
	modeled, only the production of reduced substances is described.
	These substances are in part permanently removed (e.g., pyrite formation
	below the bioturbation zone) and partly diffuse towards the oxic
	layer where they react with oxygen.
	
	The values of several parameters were constrained using literature-derived
	relationships. The model was calibrated on a dataset obtained from
	the literature, which relates the magnitude of the different pathways
	to total organic carbon mineralization. The influence of carbon flux,
	bioturbation, sedimentation rate, bottomwater concentrations of oxygen,
	and nitrate and carbon degradability on the different mineralization
	pathways is examined. The relative contribution of the oxic mineralization
	in the model is significantly depressed under high organic flux,
	under low bottomwater oxygen conditions and when the bioturbation
	increases; higher carbon degradability has only a small positive
	effect, while sedimentation rate is relatively unimportant. Denitrification
	is mainly influenced by the nitrate concentration in the overlying
	bottomwater.},

@article{Soetaert2007,
	Abstract = {The impact of biogeochemical and physical processes on aquatic chemistry
	is usually expressed in terms of alkalinity. Here we show how to
	directly calculate the effect of single processes on pH. Under the
	assumptions of equilibrium and electroneutrality, the rate of change
	of pH can be calculated as the product of (1) the net charge exchanged
	during the process and (2) the consequent buffering of pH variations.
	As both the chemical buffering and the charge of reactive species
	changes with pH, so does the effect of biogeochemical processes depend
	on pH. We calculate the effect on pH for a variety of biogeochemical
	processes, typical for both the water column and sediments, and for
	a pH range of 2-12. Four different response patterns emerge. (1)
	Some processes, e.g. nitrate assimilation, iron and manganese reduction,
	and calcite dissolution monotonically tend towards higher pH. (2)
	Other processes, e.g. calcification and most oxidation reactions
	monotonically lower the pH. (3) Most respiration reactions and the
	anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) converge to a pH between 5.2
	(aerobic respiration) and 7.9 (AOM). (4) Ammonium assimilation and
	the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) either tend to very low
	or very high pH, depending on initial conditions, i.e. pH diverges
	away from an unstable neutral point, at pH 5.2 and 7.1 respectively.
	Similar response patterns are observed when the effects of combinations
	of processes are considered. We discuss two general applications
	of our approach. (1) Biogenic calcification (C) coupled to photosynthetic
	production (P) is a type 4 process, with pH diverging from an unstable
	neutral point. (2) On the long-term, the AOM converges pH to values
	that are high enough to enable calcification. This contrasts to sulphate
	reduction, where the equilibrium pH is too low for calcification.
	This explains the strong linkage between AOM and carbonate formation,
	whilst sulphate reduction, unless it is followed by sulphide precipitation
	does generally not lead to calcification. The method is not intended
	to replace complex transport-reaction modelling where accurate prediction
	of the pH is desired.},

	Abstract = {The invertebrate zooplankton fauna of the Westerschelde (Belgium and
	The Netherlands) was investigated during 2 yr by means of monthly
	samples along a salinity gradient. Copepods were usually the most
	abundant holoplanktonic metazoans except in the freshwater zone where
	Rotifera were most numerous. The combination of a classification
	technique and an ordination-regression technique proved to be a valuable
	tool for the analysis of such an extensive data set. The presence
	of 4 groups was established, representing spatially distinct populations
	but with temporally shifting boundaries. Few zooplankton species
	were truly estuarine in their distribution, but many were derived
	from nearby coastal waters. This intrusion of marine species started
	in spring, reaching their most upstream distribution and highest
	densities in summer-early fall, then declining and retreating from
	the estuary, disappearing in winter. Fringing this community was
	a transition group with low densities, but many species. This brackish-water
	community consisted predominantly of the calanoid copepod Eurytemord
	affinis. It appeared in late fall, spread out seaward to obtain its
	maximum density and distribution in winter-early spring. Densities
	then declined and the community was absent by late summer-early fall.
	The freshwater zone near the port of Antwerp, Belgium, was characterized
	by a paucity of large zooplankters, despite the high primary production
	in this zone. This is probably due to the low oxygen availability
	in this area. A canonical Correspondence analysis revealed 2 major
	environmental axes. The salinity gradient (mainly spatial) explained
	most of the variance. Strongly correlated with this factor were dissolved
	oxygen content and secchi disc visibility. The temperature gradient
	(mainly temporal) was almost perpendicular to the salinity axis,
	indicating little or no correlation. Of lesser importance was the
	load of suspended matter, which was highest in the brackish area
	in autumn-winter. Chlorophyll content of the water was unimportant
	in explaining community structure. Copepod dry weight was maximal
	in spring in the brackish part (500 mg m-3); a lower maximum (260
	mg m-3) was observed in summer in the marine part of the estuary.},

@article{Spiteri2008,
	Abstract = {Non-conservative behavior of dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) in
	estuaries is generally ascribed to desorption from iron and aluminum
	(hydr)oxides with increasing salinity. Here, we assess this hypothesis
	by simulating the reversible adsorption of phosphate onto a model
	oxide (goethite) along physico-chemical gradients representative
	of surface and subsurface estuaries. The simulations are carried
	out using a surface complexation model (SCM), which represents the
	main aqueous speciation and adsorption reactions of DIP, plus the
	ionic strength-dependent coulombic interactions in solution and at
	the mineral-solution interface. According to the model calculations,
	variations in pH and salinity alone are unlikely to explain the often
	reported production of DIP in surface estuaries. In particular, increased
	aqueous complexation of phosphate by Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions with increasing
	salinity is offset by the formation of ternary Mg-phosphate surface
	complexes and the drop in electrical potential at the mineral-water
	interface. However, when taking into account the downstream decrease
	in the abundance of sorption sites, the model correctly simulates
	the observed release of DIP in the Scheldt estuary. The sharp increase
	in pH accompanying the admixing of seawater to fresh groundwater
	should also cause desorption of phosphate from iron oxyhydroxides
	during seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers. As for surface estuaries,
	the model calculations indicate that significant DIP release additionally
	requires a reduction in the phosphate sorption site density. In anoxic
	aquifers, this can result from the supply of seawater sulfate and
	the subsequent reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides coupled
	to microbial sulfate reduction. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

@article{Tappin2002,
	Abstract = {In a number of regions of the world, enhanced flows of nitrogen (N)
	and phosphorus (P) from land to sea are of major concern because
	of the observable deterioration in the quality of many nearshore
	marine waters. Estuaries receive N and P from river and other runoff,
	from waste discharges, from the atmosphere and ocean and from exchange
	with coastal groundwaters (which in all likelihood results in a net
	input to the estuary). For rivers that do not discharge directly
	onto the continental shelf, seaward fluxes of N and P will be modified
	by within-estuary transformations of reactive species, the burial
	of particulate N and P in sediments (sub/intertidal, saltmarsh, mangrove)
	and the loss of gaseous N and P species by bacterial reduction.
	
	Driven by a desire to understand the effects of changing N and P loads
	on water quality, and to gain insights into the true modification
	of their fluxes within estuaries, much effort has been expended on
	providing quantitative estimates of the sources and sinks of these
	constituents. Yet, accurate and precise estimates on a global scale
	remain elusive. Riverine inputs of total N and P are calculated to
	be 35-64 and 22 Mt a(-1), respectively. These inputs are dominated
	by particulate species, and because of this, are likely to be imprecise
	as overall sediment fluxes are disproportionately influenced by infrequent,
	poorly sampled, high flow events. Direct aeolian inputs of N to estuaries
	(P inputs are minor), at a minimum of 1-4 Mt a(-1), are small but
	significant, although again good estimates are hampered by the apparent
	importance of infrequent, and thus under-sampled, deposition events.
	Indirect atmospheric inputs via deposition onto and runoff from catchments
	may be highly significant, at least in environments bounding the
	North Atlantic Ocean. Groundwater inputs are generally unknown, but,
	for N, may be 5-10 Mt a(-1) (no data on P). Information on the global
	inputs of N and P from waste discharges and mariculture do not appear
	to be available. Denitrification, estimated to be ca. 33 Mt a(-1),
	may account for 52-94% of the currently estimated total N inputs;
	in contrast, the loss of P via venting of gaseous phosphine is unknown.
	The burial of N and P in sediments is about 7% and 30% of their total
	inputs, respectively. Nevertheless, reliable information on the modifying
	role of estuarine sediments appears far from complete.
	
	Globally, the inputs of N and P to the marine environment from all
	sources are expected to increase over the next few decades. The resulting
	effects of these increases on the marine environment, including any
	influences due to estuarine processing, may be partly assessed through
	the use of dynamic transport and transformation estuarine models
	for N and P. A further important development in this respect will
	be the linking of complementary models (e.g. catchment/river/estuarine/
	coastal zone) and their coupling to strategic large scale observations.

@article{Tappin2003,
	Abstract = {Results from the first multi-constituent dynamic modelling study of
	the Humber estuarine system over seasonal time scales are presented.
	The model, constructed within the ECoS3 simulation software, has
	been calibrated using data obtained from 27 surveys of the Yorkshire
	Ouse and Humber estuaries during 1994-1996. The model is tidally
	averaged, and is one-dimensional in the vertical and in cross-section.
	Daily-varying longitudinal concentration profiles of SPM, POC, nitrate,
	nitrite and ammonium have been simulated, and these have been compared
	with the observations used for model calibration (model confirmation).
	The fits are generally good. The model captures the marked seasonal
	variability in concentrations of the particulate constituents (SPM,
	POC), and places the turbidity maximum in approximately the correct
	region of the estuary. There was a high degree of scatter in the
	SPM and POC concentrations measured due to tidal resuspension, which
	was not reproduced by the tidally averaged model. Comparisons between
	measured and simulated nitrate + nitrite are satisfactory, although
	for a number of surveys the modelled values are systematically too
	low in the lower Yorkshire Ouse and upper Humber. These discrepancies
	are not readily explained, but may be linked to inadequately characterised
	source terms for this nitrogen. The general trends in the concentrations
	and distributions of ammonium are reproduced by the model, despite
	the plethora of external inputs of this constituent, and significant
	modifications to ammonium transport by in situ nitrification and
	benthic exchange. The simulated concentrations and distributions
	have also been tested against independent data encapsulating axial
	transects in the Trent and Humber estuaries, and temporal variations
	at fixed sites on the Trent and Yorkshire Ouse estuaries. With some
	exceptions, the fits between the model results and these data are
	also good. The model has also been used to construct constituent
	budgets (external/internal sources and sinks) for each estuary for
	1994, 1995 and 1996. Riverine inputs of SPM, POC, nitrate, nitrite
	and ammonium decreased over the 3 years, presumably reflecting changing
	patterns of terrestrial runoff coupled to a reduction in effluent
	inputs. This trend was also observed in the point discharges of these
	constituents direct to the estuary. The simulated estuary was a source
	of sediments to the North Sea during 1994 and 1996, but a sink during
	1995. The difference has been ascribed to the exceptionally dry summer
	and autumn of 1995, in which up-estuary tidal 'pumping' of SPM was
	dominant over down-estuary flushing by river water. Fluvial inputs
	represent an important external source of POC to the model estuary
	(27-55%), as does the North Sea (26-58%). These inputs are exceeded
	by POC loss via bacterial remineralisation, suggesting that the estuarine
	bed is a net source of POC. Riverine inputs account for 76-77% of
	the external inputs of nitrate. This constituent behaves quasi-conservatively
	in the estuary, reflecting the dilution of nitrate-rich river waters
	with low-nitrate coastal water, although nitrification is a significant
	input (approx. 21%). Denitrification is small, and consequently all
	nitrate added to the estuary is lost to the North Sea. External loads
	of nitrite are small and ammonium nitrification accounts for approximately
	93% of its annual input. Practically all of the nitrite is oxidised
	to nitrate, and little escapes to the North Sea. The fluvial and
	direct waste inputs of ammonium to the estuary are of similar size.
	Most of the ammonium in the model is nitrified (98-100%) and only
	a few
	
	In 1996 the estuary appears to have been a sink for coastal water
	ammonium. Constituent budgets are compared with independently evaluated
	fluxes. There is good agreement in a number of cases, but the comparison
	highlights the main uncertainties in the simulated fluxes. It is
	concluded that the model as currently formulated provides an excellent
	basis for heuristic studies of the Humber estuarine system. (C) 2003

@article{Thiele1999,
	Abstract = {We present the recursive dynamic programming (RDP) method for the
	threading approach to three-dimensional protein structure prediction.
	RDP is based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm and maps the protein
	sequence whose backbone structure is to be found (the protein target)
	onto the known backbone structure of a model protein (the protein
	template) in a stepwise fashion, a technique that is similar to computing
	local alignments but utilising different cost functions. We begin
	by mapping parts of the target onto the template that show statistically
	significant similarity with the template sequence. After mapping,
	the template structure is modified in order to account for the mapped
	target residues. Then significant similarities between the yet unmapped
	parts of the target and the modified template are searched, and the
	resulting segments of the target are mapped onto the template. This
	recursive process of identifying segments in the target to be mapped
	onto the template and modifying the template is continued until no
	significant similarities between the remaining parts of target and
	template are found. Those parts which are left unmapped by the procedure
	are interpreted as gaps.The RDP method is robust in the sense that
	different local alignment methods can be used, several alternatives
	of mapping parts of the target onto the template can be handled and
	compared in the process, and the cost functions can be dynamically
	adapted to biological needs.Our computer experiments show that the
	RDP procedure is efficient and effective. We can thread a typical
	protein sequence against a database of 887 template domains in about
	12 hours even on a low-cost workstation (SUN Ultra 5). In statistical
	evaluations on databases of known protein structures, RDP significantly
	outperforms competing methods. RDP has been especially valuable in
	providing accurate alignments for modeling active sites of proteins.RDP

	Abstract = {Due to their extensive structural heterogeneity, the elucidation of
	glycosylation patterns in glycoproteins such as the subunits of human
	chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), hCG-alpha, and hCG-beta, remains one
	of the most challenging problems in the proteomic analysis of post-translational
	modifications. In consequence, glycosylation is usually studied after
	decomposition of the intact proteins to the proteolytic peptide level.
	However, by this approach all information about the combination of
	the different glycopeptides in the intact protein is lost. In this
	study we have, therefore, attempted to combine the results of glycan
	identification after tryptic digestion with molecular mass measurements
	on the native starting material of the new first WHO Reference Reagents
	(RR) for hCG-alpha (99/720) and hCG-beta (99/650). Despite the extremely
	high number of possible combinations of the glycans identified in
	the tryptic peptides by HPLC-MS (> 1000 for hCG-alpha and > 10000
	for hCG-beta), the mass spectra of intact hCG-alpha and hCG-beta
	revealed only a limited number of glycoforms present in hCG preparations
	from pools of pregnancy urines. Peak annotations for hCG-alpha were
	performed with the help of a bioinformatic algorithm that generated
	a database containing all possible modifications of the proteins,
	including modifications possibly introduced during sample preparation
	such as oxidation or truncation, for subsequent searches for combinations
	fitting the mass difference between the polypeptide backbone and
	the measured molecular masses. Fourteen different glycoforms of hCG-alpha,
	containing biantennary, partly sialylized hybrid-type glycans, including
	methionine-oxidized and N-terminally truncated forms, were identified.
	Mass spectra of high quality were also obtained for hCG-beta, however,
	a database search mass accuracy of +/- 5 Da was insufficient to unambiguously
	assign the possible combinations of post-translational modifications.
	In summary, mass spectrometric fingerprints of intact molecules were
	shown to be highly useful for the characterization of glycosylation
	patterns of different hCG preparations such as the new first WHO
	FIR for immunoassays and could be the first step in establishing
	biophysical reference methods for hCG and related molecules.},

	Abstract = {We tracked flows of carbon and nitrogen during an experimental phytoplankton
	bloom in a natural estuarine assemblage in Randers Fjord, Denmark.
	We used C-13-labeled dissolved inorganic carbon to trace the transfer
	of carbon from phytoplankton to bacteria. Ecosystem development was
	followed over a period of 9 d through changes in the stocks of inorganic
	nutrients, pigments, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, dissolved
	organic carbon (DOC), and algal and bacterial polar-lipid-derived
	fatty acids (PLFA). We quantified the incorporation of C-13 in phytoplankton
	and bacterial biomass by carbon isotope analysis of specific PLFA.
	A dynamic model based on unbalanced algal growth and balanced growth
	of bacteria and zooplankton adequately reproduced the observations
	and provided an integral view of carbon and nitrogen dynamics. There
	were three phases with distinct carbon and nitrogen dynamics. During
	the first period, nutrients were replete, an algal bloom was observed,
	and carbon and nitrogen uptake occurred at a constant ratio. Because
	there was little algal exudation of DOC, transfer of C-13 from phytoplankton
	to bacteria was delayed by 1 d, compared with the labeling of phytoplankton.
	In the second phase, the exhaustion of dissolved inorganic nitrogen
	resulted in decoupling of carbon and nitrogen flows caused by unbalanced
	algal growth and the exudation of carbon-rich dissolved organic matter
	by phytoplankton. During the final, nutrient-depleted phase, carbon
	and nitrogen cycling were dominated by the microbial loop and there
	was accumulation of DOC. The main source (60%) of DOC was exudation
	by phytoplankton growing under nitrogen limitation. Heterotrophic
	processes were the main source of dissolved organic nitrogen (94%).
	Most of the carbon exudated by algae was respired by the bacteria
	and did not pass to higher trophic levels. The dynamic model successfully
	reproduced the evolution of trophic pathways during the transition
	from nutrient-replete to -depleted conditions, which indicates that
	simple models provide a powerful tool to study the response of pelagic
	ecosystems to external forcings.},

	Keywords = {Estuaries Biogeochemistry Modelling Nutrients Estuarine dynamics Brackishwater pollution Scheldt A fully coupled, two-dimensional hydrodynamic and reactive-transport model of C, N, O2 and Si along a river-estuarine-coastal zone system is presented. It is applied to the Scheldt continuum, a macrotidal environment strongly affected by anthropogenic perturbations. The model extends from the upper tidal river and its tributaries to the southern Bight of the North Sea. Five dynamically linked nested grids are used, with a spatial resolution progressively increasing from 33 m to 2.7 km. The biogeochemical reaction network consists of aerobic degradation, nitrification, denitrification, phytoplankton growth and mortality, as well as reaeration. Diagnostic simulations of a typical summer situation in the early 1990s are compared to field data taken from the OMES database (> 300 samples per variable). Results demonstrate that the process rates in the tidal river are very high and far larger than in the saline estuary, with maximum nitrification rates in the water column up to 70 mM N day- 1, and maximum aerobic respiration and denitrification up to 70 and 40 mM C day- 1, respectively. Phytoplankton production is about one order of magnitude lower, a result which confirms the dominance of heterotrophic processes in this system. The influence of secondary and tertiary wastewater treatment in the catchment is then assessed. Results show a significant decrease of organic matter and ammonium concentrations above Antwerp, which in turn leads to a partial restoration of oxygen levels. The model also predicts a reduction of denitrification rates, which locally results in a 4-fold increase of the nitrate concentration. Mass budgets for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are established for the saline estuary (km 0 to 100) and for the tidal river network (km 100 to 160). Three scenarios, corresponding to the situation in the early 1990s, the years 2000 and the situation expected in 2010 are considered. They show that the tidal river and the estuary contribute almost equally to the overall biogeochemical cycling of these elements, despite the very different water volumes involved. For the simulated periods, the large decrease in nitrogen input (> 55%) expected between 1990 and 2010 will not lead to a significant decrease of N export to the coastal zone during the summer period.},

	Abstract = {In the frame of the BIOGEST project, the full transient, one-dimensional,
	reactive-transport model CONTRASTE has been extended for the computation
	of biogases in the Scheldt estuary. The CONTRASTE model (Coupled,
	Networked, Transport-Reaction Algorithm for Strong Tidal Estuaries)
	provides a satisfactory description of the estuarine residual circulation
	(including daily freshwater discharge and a complete description
	of the tide) and a flexible implementation of the various physico-chemical
	and biological transformations, including both kinetically-controlled
	and equilibrium reactions. The model allows resolution of the complex,
	nonlinear collective behaviour of this type of system and investigation
	of the non-steady-state phenomena which govern estuarine dynamics.
	Variables currently implemented in the model include salinity, suspended
	matter, oxygen, inorganic carbon species, degradable organic carbon
	and nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen species, freshwater and marine phytoplankton.
	Biological processes described are heterotrophic respiration, primary
	production, nitrification and denitrification. Equilibrium formulations
	allow for DIC and NH4+/NH3 speciation. Physical processes include
	gas transfer at the water/air interface, depending on both wind speed
	and current velocity. pH profiles are explicitly computed and constitute
	a very sensitive check of the overall model consistency. Results
	of the CONTRASTE model are in very good agreement with the measured
	longitudinal distribution of the variables considered, in particular
	O-2, pH, pCO(2) and N2O concentrations. However, discrepancies are
	observed between the calculated fluxes of CO2 and those estimated
	using an in situ floating chamber. It is shown that the evaluation
	of gas transfer can be affected by serious errors if the variations
	due to changes in current velocity and water depth during one tidal
	cycle are not taken into consideration. The model also shows that
	the fluxes of biogases in estuaries are greatly influenced by the
	quasi-exponential increase of the exchange surface area with decreasing
	distance to the sea. Our estimation of the total daily flux of O-2,
	CO2 and N2O is equal to +28500, -19000 and -17 kmoles.day(-1) respectively

	The depth distributions of NH4+ and delta-N-15-NH4+ for Black Sea

@article{Wang1996,
	Abstract = {STEADYSED1 is a multicomponent reactive transport code for steady-state
	early diagenesis which fully incorporates the reaction couplings
	among the elements, C, O, N, S, Fe, and Mn. The model is tested against
	extensive datasets collected by Canfield et al. (1993a,b) at three
	coastal marine sites that exhibit high rates of combined iron and
	manganese (hydr)oxide reduction. It is shown that the model provides
	a consistent explanation of the entire body of multicomponent multisite
	observations. The measured concentration profiles of twenty-eight
	individual porewater and solid sediment species are satisfactorily
	reproduced. Furthermore, the model predicts the observed distributions
	of sulfate reduction rates, as well as diagnostic features of the
	porewater pH profiles.
	
	The coupled nature of the reactive species imposes stringent constraints
	when fitting model-calculated distributions to the data, because
	a single set of reaction and transport parameters must account for
	the profiles of all the species at each site. The parameters are
	further separated into site-specific (e.g., deposition fluxes, bottom
	water composition) and reaction-specific parameters (e.g., rate coefficients,
	apparent equilibrium constants, limiting substrate concentrations).
	By minimizing the variations of the reaction-specific parameters
	from one site to another, the fitting strategy emphasizes the retrieval
	from field data of reaction parameters that are mechanistically meaningful.
	
	The model reproduces the significant vertical overlap between organic
	carbon oxidation pathways observed in the sediments. The overlap
	is explained by the combination of high rates of organic carbon oxidation
	plus intense bioturbation and irrigation at the sites studied. The
	model-derived contributions of the various respiratory processes
	compare favorably with the incubation results of Canfield et al.
	(1993a,b). Aerobic respiration accounts for less than 32% of total
	organic carbon oxidation at the three sites. From 22 to 46% of the
	O-2 uptake by the sediments is directly coupled to organic carbon
	oxidation, while the remainder is used for the oxidation of secondary
	reduced species, in particular dissolved, adsorbed and solid Fe(II)
	and Mn(II) species.
	
	According to the model, the oxidation of Fe2+ by Mn (hydr)oxides is
	responsible for the observed spatial separation of the porewater
	build-up of Mn2+ and Fe2+. At two of the sites, 75 and 97% of the
	total rate of Mn oxide reduction is due to chemical reaction with
	dissolved Fe2+. In contrast, at the same sites, iron (hydr)oxides
	are mostly utilized by bacteria for the oxidation of organic matter
	(dissimilatory iron reduction). As shown also by Canfield et al.
	(1993a,b), dissimilatory reduction is the principal dissolution pathway
	for manganese oxides at the third site. A sensitivity analysis suggests
	that, for given deposition fluxes of reactive Fe and Mn, the competition
	between dissimilatory and nondissimilatory metal reduction pathways
	depends primarily on the total carbon oxidation rate and the intensity
	of porewater irrigation. The simulations also highlight the importance
	of adsorption-desorption of Fe(II) and Mn(II) in the redox cycling
	of the metals, as well as their impact on porewater alkalinity and
	pH. Based on the calculated rate distributions, detailed budgets
	of Fe, Mn, and O-2 in the sediments are presented.
	
	The model-calculated benthic exchange fluxes of solutes are dominated
	by irrigation. For nitrate, molecular diffusion and irrigation cause
	fluxes in opposite directions. As a result, there is a net transfer
	of nitrate from the water column to the sediments, although the interfacial
	porewater gradients predict diffusional fluxes out of the sediments.
	A significant fraction of the benthic Fe and Mn fluxes to the bottom
	waters may be due to desorption at the water-sediment interface.},

	Abstract = {The US southeastern continental shelf, also known as the South Atlantic
	Bight (SAB), is a strong source of CO, to the atmosphere, which is
	in direct contrast to recent reports regarding other major continental
	shelves. Both spatial (cross-shelf) and seasonal variations of the
	CO2 system were pronounced in the SAB. Sea surface pCO(2) in winter
	was undersaturated relative to the atmosphere, while oversaturation
	of pCO(2) dominated the entire shelf water in all other seasons.
	Annually, the SAB releases CO2 to the atmosphere at an average rate
	of 30g Cm-2 (2.5 mol cm(-2)). This system also discharges dissolved
	inorganic carbon to the open ocean (30 g C m(-2) yr(-1)). Methods
	of estimating CO2 flux and DIC flux are critically evaluated and
	compared. A carbon mass balance model in the SAB is presented based
	on inorganic carbon fluxes from this study and organic carbon fluxes
	from literature. The carbon budget is much closer to balance by using
	this carbon flux approach than by direct measurements of primary
	production and respiration. It is concluded that the SAB is a net
	heterotrophic system annually. Intensified hearing, elevated input
	of inorganic carbon from coastal salt marshes, microbial respiration
	of marsh-exported organic carbon and the lack of annual spring blooms
	all contribute to maintaining the SAB as a strong CO2 Source to the
	atmosphere during the warm seasons. In winter, the primary factor
	that governs the CO2 sink in the SAB is likely the cooling process.
	Strong heterotrophy during warm seasons also sustains the SAB to
	be an exporter of inorganic carbon to the open ocean annually. The
	SAB shelf functions differently from the East China Sea, the North
	Atlantic European Shelves, and the Mid-Atlantic Bight as a source
	or sink of atmospheric CO2. The SAB is classified as a "marsh-dominated"
	shelf as compared to other shelves in terms of carbon dynamics. Further
	work to study carbon dynamics in coastal margins is warranted to
	interpret their roles in the global CO, budget. (c) 2005 Elsevier

	Abstract = {The publication of the crystal structures of the ribosome offers an
	opportunity to retrospectively evaluate the information content of
	hundreds of qualitative biochemical and biophysical studies of these
	structures. We assessed the correspondence between more than 2,500
	experimental proximity measurements and the distances observed in
	the ribosomal crystals. Although detailed experimental procedures
	and protocols are unique in almost each analyzed paper, the data
	can be grouped into subsets with similar patterns and analyzed in
	an integrative fashion. We found that, for crosslinking, footprinting,
	and cleavage data, the corresponding distances observed in crystal
	structures generally did not exceed the maximum values expected (from
	the estimated length of the agent and maximal anticipated deviations
	from the conformations found in crystals). However, the distribution
	of distances had heavier tails than those typically assumed when
	building three-dimensional models, and the fraction of incompatible
	distances was greater than expected. Some of these incompatibilities
	can be attributed to the experimental methods used. In addition,
	the accuracy of these procedures appears to be sensitive to the different
	reactivities, flexibilities, and interactions among the components.
	These findings demonstrate the necessity of a very careful analysis
	of data used for structural modeling and consideration of all possible
	parameters that could potentially influence the quality of measurements.
	We conclude that experimental proximity measurements can provide
	useful distance information for structural modeling, but with a broad
	distribution of inferred distance ranges. We also conclude that development
	of automated modeling approaches would benefit from better annotations
	of experimental data for detection and interpretation of their significance.},

	Abstract = {Diatoms, one of the most productive phytoplankton groups in the ocean,
	have an essential requirement for silicic acid for the construction
	of their opaline shells. In seawater, silicic acid is present in
	three chemical species (H4SiO4, H3SiO4-, and H2SiO42-). The silicic
	acid molecule actually taken up by diatoms is still under discussion.
	Algal cells are surrounded by a diffusive boundary layer (DBL) which
	has an effective thickness of the order of the cell radius. The nutrient
	transport through this layer is by diffusion only and thus may limit
	the supply of silicic acid to the cell. Due to uptake of one of the
	species of silicic acid by the cell, the chemical system in the DBL
	is out of equilibrium. We have developed a diffusion-reaction model
	the components H4SiO4, H3SiO4-, H2SiO42-, OH- and OH+ in the DBL
	which allows us to calculate maximum silicic acid supply rates as
	a function of the total concentration of dissolved silicon, pH, algal
	radius, and silicic acid species taken up by the cell. In addition,
	analytical solutions for the simplified diffusion-reaction system
	are presented. Model calculations of the silicic acid maximum uptake
	rates are compared with uptake data for Thalassiosira weissflogii
	from recent laboratory experiments. Results indicate that the supply
	of H4SiO4 to T weissflogii by diffusion-reaction processes is sufficient
	to sustain the observed growth rates. Thus, the H4SiO4 uptake of
	T weissflogii is not diffusion-limited. This does not hold true for
	H3SiO4-. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The assessment of direct effects of anthropogenic $CO_2$ increase
	on the marine biota has received relatively little attention compared
	to the intense research on $CO_2$-related responses of the terrestrial
	biosphere. Yet, due to the rapid air-sea gas exchange, the observed
	past and predicted future rise in atmospheric $CO_2$ causes a corresponding
	increase in seawater $CO_2$ concentrations, [$CO_2$], in upper ocean
	waters. Increasing [$CO_2$] leads to considerable changes in the
	surface ocean carbonate system, resulting in decreases in pH and
	the carbonate concentration, [CO32-]. These changes can be shown
	to have strong impacts on the marine biota. Here we will distinguish
	between $CO_2$-related responses of the marine biota which (a) potentially
	affect the ocean's biological carbon pumps and (b) are relevant to
	the interpretation of diagnostic tools (proxies) used to assess climate
	change on geological times scales. With regard to the former, three
	direct effects of increasing [$CO_2$] on marine plankton have been
	recognized: enhanced phytoplankton growth rate, changing elemental
	composition of primary produced organic matter, and reduced biogenic
	calcification. Although quantitative estimates of their impacts on
	the oceanic carbon cycle are not yet feasible, all three effects
	increase the ocean's capacity to take up and store atmospheric $CO_2$
	and hence, can serve as negative feedbacks to anthropogenic $CO_2$
	increase. With respect to proxies used in paleo-reconstructions,
	$CO_2$-sensitivity is found in carbon isotope fractionation by phytoplankton
	and foraminifera. While $CO_2$-dependent isotope fractionation by
	phytoplankton may be of potential use in reconstructing surface ocean
	pCO(2) at ancient times, $CO_2$-related effects on the isotopic composition
	of foraminiferal shells confounds the use of the difference in isotopic
	signals between planktonic and benthic shells as a measure for the
	strength of marine primary production. The latter effect also offers
	an alternative explanation for the large negative swings in delta(13)C
	of foraminiferal calcite between glacial and interglacial periods.
	Changes in [CO32-] affect the delta(18)O in foraminiferal shells.
	Taking this into account brings sea surface temperature estimates
	for the glacial tropics closer to those obtained from other geochemical
	proxies.},

	data structure called a conditional distribution matrix. The conditional

	matrix by changing the context of substitution from a single amino
	acid to a group of amino acids. The matrix tabulates information
	from a database of protein families that contains numerous aligned
	positions. Each row in the matrix contains the distribution of amino
	acids in those aligned positions that contain a given conditioning
	group of amino acids. The method converts a database of protein families
	into a conditional distribution matrix and then examines each possible
	substitution group for evidence of conservation. The algorithm is
	applied to the BLOCKS and HSSP databases. Twenty amino acid substitution
	groups are found to be conserved empirically in both databases. These

	problem, a scoring function combines the values for different parameters
	of possible sequence-to-structure alignments into a single score
	to allow for unambiguous optimization. In this context, an essential
	question is how each property should be weighted. As the native structures
	are known for some sequences, a partial ordering on optimal alignments
	to other structures, e.g., derived from structural comparisons, may
	be used to adjust the weights. To resolve the arising interdependence
	of weights and computed solutions, we propose a heuristic approach:
	iterating the computation of solutions (here, threading alignments)
	given the weights and the estimation of optimal weights of the scoring
	function given these solutions via systematic calibration methods.
	For our application (i.e., threading), this iterative approach results
